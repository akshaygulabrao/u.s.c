                (i) 
                    (i)
                    the estimated cost to the Federal Government (based on offers received) for performance of the function by a contractor;

                    (i)
                    10 percent of the personnel-related costs for performance of that function in the agency tender; or

            There is a record in each executive agency of each holder of a purchase card issued by the agency for official use, annotated with the limitations on single transactions and total transactions that are applicable to the use of each such card or check by that purchase card holder.
        (2)

                (A)
                reconciling the charges appearing on each statement of account for that purchase card with receipts and other supporting documentation; and

                (B)
                forwarding a summary report to the certifying official in a timely manner of information necessary to enable the certifying official to ensure that the Federal Government ultimately pays only for valid charges that are consistent with the terms of the applicable Government-wide purchase card contract entered into by the Administrator of General Services.
        (4) 
            (4)
            Any disputed purchase card charge, and any discrepancy between a receipt and other supporting documentation and the purchase card statement of account, is resolved in the manner prescribed in the applicable Government-wide purchase card contract entered into by the Administrator of General Services.
        (5) 
            (5)

        (7) 
            (7)
            Records of each purchase card transaction (including records on associated contracts, reports, accounts, and invoices) are retained in accordance with standard Government policies on the disposition of records.

            (9)
            Appropriate training is provided to each purchase card holder and each official with responsibility for overseeing the use of purchase cards issued by the executive agency.

            (10)
            The executive agency has specific policies regarding the number of purchase cards issued by various component organizations and categories of component organizations, the credit limits authorized for various categories of card holders, and categories of employees eligible to be issued purchase cards, and that those policies are designed to minimize the financial risk to the Federal Government of the issuance of the purchase cards and to ensure the integrity of purchase card holders.
        (11) 
            (11)
            The executive agency uses effective systems, techniques, and technologies to prevent or identify illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases.
        (12) 
            (12)
            The executive agency invalidates the purchase card of each employee who—

                (A)
                ceases to be employed by the agency, immediately upon termination of the employment of the employee; or

            The executive agency takes steps to recover the cost of any illegal, improper, or erroneous purchase made with a purchase card or convenience check by an employee, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.

            Modular Contracting Described
        Under modular contracting, an executive agency’s need for a system is satisfied in successive acquisitions of interoperable increments.

        (1) 
            (1)
            under the modular contracting process, an acquisition of a major system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that—
            (A) 
                (A)
                are easier to manage individually than would be one comprehensive acquisition;

                (C)
                provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments, each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on a subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions; and
            (D) 
                (D)
                provide an opportunity for subsequent increments of the acquisition to take advantage of any evolution in technology or needs that occurs during conduct of the earlier increments;
        (2) 
            (2)
            to the maximum extent practicable, a contract for an increment of an information technology acquisition should be awarded within 180 days after the solicitation is issued and, if the contract for that increment cannot be awarded within that period, the increment should be considered for cancellation; and
        (3) 
            (3)
            the information technology provided for in a contract for acquisition of information technology should be delivered within 18 months after the solicitation resulting in award of the contract was issued.

            The regulations required by subsection (b) shall provide that each individual purchase of property or services in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold that is made under a multiple award contract shall be made on a competitive basis unless a contracting officer—
            (A) 
                (A)
                waives the requirement on the basis of a determination that—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    one of the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) to (4) of

                    (ii)
                    a law expressly authorizes or requires that the purchase be made from a specified source; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                justifies the determination in writing.
        (2) 
            (2)
                Competitive basis procedures
            For purposes of this subsection, an individual purchase of property or services is made on a competitive basis only if it is made pursuant to procedures that—
            (A) 
                (A)
                require fair notice of the intent to make that purchase (including a description of the work to be performed and the basis on which the selection will be made) to be provided to all contractors offering the property or services under the multiple award contract; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                afford all contractors responding to the notice a fair opportunity to make an offer and have that offer fairly considered by the official making the purchase.
        (3) 
            (3)
                Exception to notice requirement.—
            (A) 
                (A)
                    In general
                Notwithstanding paragraph (2), and subject to subparagraph (B), notice may be provided to fewer than all contractors offering the property or services under a multiple award contract as described in subsection (a)(3)(A) if notice is provided to as many contractors as practicable.
            (B) 
                (B)
                    Limitation on exception
                A purchase may not be made pursuant to a notice that is provided to fewer than all contractors under subparagraph (A) unless—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    offers were received from at least 3 qualified contractors; or
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    a contracting officer of the executive agency determines in writing that no additional qualified contractors were able to be identified despite reasonable efforts to do so.

            (B) 
                (B)
                disclose the determination required by subsection (c)(1) related to sole source task or delivery orders in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold placed against multiple award contracts through the same mechanism and to the same extent as the disclosure of documents containing a justification and approval required by
                    section 3204(e)(1) of title 10
                    section 3304(e)(1) of this title

            (2)
                Exemption

        (a)
            Exclusion of Particular Source.—
        (1) 
            (1)
                Criteria for exclusion
            An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by
                section 3301 of this title
            (A) 
                (A)
                increase or maintain competition and likely result in reduced overall cost for the procurement, or for an anticipated procurement, of the property or services;
            (B) 
                (B)
                be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;
            (C) 
                (C)
                be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a Federally funded research and development center;
            (D) 
                (D)
                ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of the property or service;
            (E) 
                (E)
                satisfy projected needs for the property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or
            (F) 
                (F)
                satisfy a critical need for medical, safety, or emergency supplies.

            A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.
    (b) 
        (b)
            Exclusion of Other Than Small Business Concerns
        An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by
            section 3301 of this title
            15 U.S.C. 638
    (c) 
        (c)
            Nonapplication of Justification and Approval Requirements
        A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in subsections (a) and (b) is not subject to the justification and approval required by
            section 3304(e)(1) of this title
§ 3304. Use of noncompetitive procedures
    (a) 
        (a)
            When Noncompetitive Procedures May Be Used
        An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when—
        (1) 
            (1)
            the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;
        (2) 
            (2)
            the executive agency’s need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Federal Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;
        (3) 
            (3)
            it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source—
            (A) 
                (A)
                to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization;
            (B) 
                (B)
                to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a Federally funded research and development center;
            (C) 
                (C)
                to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before a court, administrative tribunal, or agency, whether or not the expert is expected to testify; or
            (D) 
                (D)
                to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;
        (4) 
            (4)
            the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the Federal Government and a foreign government or an international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for that government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;
        (5) 
            (5)
            subject to
                section 3105 of this title
        (6) 
            (6)
            the disclosure of the executive agency’s needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or
        (7) 
            (7)
            the head of the executive agency (who may not delegate the authority under this paragraph)—
            (A) 
                (A)
                determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                notifies Congress in writing of that determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.
    (b) 
        (b)
            Property or Services Deemed Available From Only One Source
        For the purposes of subsection (a)(1), in the case of—
        (1) 
            (1)
            a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services are deemed to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept, the substance of which is not otherwise available to the Federal Government and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; or
        (2) 
            (2)
            a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in—
            (A) 
                (A)
                substantial duplication of cost to the Federal Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or
            (B) 
                (B)
                unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency’s needs.
    (c) 
        (c)
            Property or Services Needed With Unusual and Compelling Urgency.—
        (1) 
            (1)
                Allowable contract period
            The contract period of a contract described in paragraph (2) that is entered into by an executive agency pursuant to the authority provided under subsection (a)(2)—
            (A) 
                (A)
                may not exceed the time necessary—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    to meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the work to be performed under the contract; and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    for the executive agency to enter into another contract for the required goods or services through the use of competitive procedures; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                may not exceed one year unless the head of the executive agency entering into the contract determines that exceptional circumstances apply.
        (2) 
            (2)
                Applicability of allowable contract period
            This subsection applies to any contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.
    (d) 
        (d)
            Offer Requests to Potential Sources
        An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of paragraph (2) or (6) of subsection (a) shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.
    (e) 
        (e)
            Justification for Use of Noncompetitive Procedures.—
        (1) 
            (1)
                Prerequisites for awarding contract

                    (ii)
                    exceeding $10,000,000 but equal to or less than $50,000,000, by the head of the procuring activity or by a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in which the individual is entitled to receive the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or
                (iii) 
                    (iii)

    (a) 
        (a)
            Provision Requiring Adjustment.—
        (1) 
            (1)
                In general
            A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under
                section 3502(b) of this title
        (2) 
            (2)
                What constitutes defective cost or pricing data
            For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data that, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed on between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree on a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed on by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.
    (b) 
        (b)
            Valid Defense
        In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.
    (c) 
        (c)
            Invalid Defenses
        It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor—
            (A) 
                (A)
                was the sole source of the property or services procured; or
            (B) 
                (B)
                otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;
        (2) 
            (2)
            the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;
        (3) 
            (3)
            the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the Federal Government about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract; or
        (4) 
            (4)
            the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required by
                section 3502(b) of this title
    (d) 
        (d)
            Offsets.—
        (1) 
            (1)
                When allowed
            A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if—
            (A) 
                (A)
                the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor’s knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in
                    section 3502(c) of this title
        (2) 
            (2)
                When not allowed
            A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if—
            (A) 
                (A)
                the certification under
                    section 3502(b) of this title
            (B) 
                (B)
                the Federal Government proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in paragraph (1)(B) been submitted to the Federal Government before date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, under subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, the submission of the cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.
§ 3507. Interest and penalties for certain overpayments
    (a) 
        (a)
            In General
        If the Federal Government makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this chapter and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the Federal Government—
        (1) 
            (1)
            for interest on the amount of the overpayment, to be computed—
            (A) 
                (A)
                for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of the overpayment to the Federal Government; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (
                    26 U.S.C. 6621
        (2) 
            (2)
            if the submission of the defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.
    (b)

            Indirect Cost That Violates Federal Acquisition Regulation Cost Principle
        An executive agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the executive agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after those costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost that is unallowable because the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or an executive agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.

            Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle.—

            (1)
                Unallowable cost in proposal
            If the executive agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to—
            (A)

    (c) 
        (c)
            Waiver of Penalty
        The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor’s proposal for settlement of indirect costs when—

        (2) 
            (2)

            (A) 
                (A)
                it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor’s proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and
            (B)

                In general
            Not later than 30 days after receiving an Inspector General report pursuant to subsection (b), the head of the executive agency concerned shall determine whether there is sufficient basis to conclude that the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, subgrantee, or personal services contractor concerned has subjected the complainant to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:
            (A) 
                (A)
                Order the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, subgrantee, or personal services contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.
            (B) 
                (B)
                Order the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, subgrantee, or personal services contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.
            (C) 
                (C)
                Order the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, subgrantee, or personal services contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expert witnesses’ fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the executive agency.
            (D) 
                (D)
                Consider disciplinary or corrective action against any official of the executive agency, if appropriate.
        (2) 
            (2)
                Exhaustion of remedies
            If the head of an executive agency issues an order denying relief under paragraph (1) or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of a complaint under subsection (b), or in the case of an extension of time under paragraph (b)(2)(B), not later than 30 days after the expiration of the extension of time, and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant, the complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint, and the complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, subgrantee, or personal services contractor to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under this section in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this paragraph may not be brought more than two years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.
        (3) 
            (3)
                Admissibility of evidence

        (4) 
            (4)
                Enforcement of orders
            Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency concerned shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the executive agency.
        (5) 
            (5)
                Judicial review
            Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order’s conformance with this subsection, and any regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the executive agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order of the head of an executive agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.
