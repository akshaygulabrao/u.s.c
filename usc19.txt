        Marking of articles
        Except as hereinafter provided, every article of foreign origin (or its container, as provided in subsection (b) hereof) imported into the United States shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly, and permanently as the nature of the article (or container) will permit in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of the article. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations—
            (1)
            Determine the character of words and phrases or abbreviations thereof which shall be acceptable as indicating the country of origin and prescribe any reasonable method of marking, whether by printing, stenciling, stamping, branding, labeling, or by any other reasonable method, and a conspicuous place on the article (or container) where the marking shall appear;
            (2)
            Require the addition of any other words or symbols which may be appropriate to prevent deception or mistake as to the origin of the article or as to the origin of any other article with which such imported article is usually combined subsequent to importation but before delivery to an ultimate purchaser; and
            (3)
            Authorize the exception of any article from the requirements of marking if—
                (A)
                Such article is incapable of being marked;
                (B)
                Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States without injury;
                (C)
                Such article cannot be marked prior to shipment to the United States, except at an expense economically prohibitive of its importation;
                (D)
                The marking of a container of such article will reasonably indicate the origin of such article;
                (E)
                Such article is a crude substance;
                (F)
                Such article is imported for use by the importer and not intended for sale in its imported or any other form;
                (G)
                Such article is to be processed in the United States by the importer or for his account otherwise than for the purpose of concealing the origin of such article and in such manner that any mark contemplated by this section would necessarily be obliterated, destroyed, or permanently concealed;
                (H)
                An ultimate purchaser, by reason of the character of such article or by reason of the circumstances of its importation, must necessarily know the country of origin of such article even though it is not marked to indicate its origin;
                (I)
                Such article was produced more than twenty years prior to its importation into the United States;
                (J)
                Such article is of a class or kind with respect to which the Secretary of the Treasury has given notice by publication in the weekly Treasury Decisions within two years after

                    September 1, 1938
                (K)
                Such article cannot be marked after importation except at any expense which is economically prohibitive, and the failure to mark the article before importation was not due to any purpose of the importer, producer, seller, or shipper to avoid compliance with this section.
    Marking of containers
        (b)
        Marking of containers
            Whenever an article is excepted under subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section from the requirements of marking, the immediate container, if any, of such article, or such other container or containers of such article as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be marked in such manner as to indicate to an ultimate purchaser in the United States the English name of the country of origin of such article, subject to all provisions of this section, including the same exceptions as are applicable to articles under subdivision (3) of subsection (a).

            (2)
            If, because of the nature of an article, it is technically or commercially infeasible to mark it by one of the five methods specified in paragraph (1), the article may be marked by an equally permanent method of marking or, in the case of small diameter pipe, tube, and fittings, by tagging the containers or bundles.

            the place to which such book or matter is addressed;
        and the United States attorney shall institute proceedings in the district court for the forfeiture, confiscation, and destruction of the book or matter seized. Upon the adjudication that such book or matter thus seized is of the character the entry of which is by this section prohibited, it shall be ordered destroyed and shall be destroyed.

            (5)
                (A)

                (B)
                In any matter referred to a United States attorney for possible criminal prosecution wherein subparagraph (5)(A) does not apply, the United States attorney shall immediately notify the Customs Service in writing concerning the disposition of the matter, whether by institution of a prosecution or a letter of declination, and shall also furnish a copy of the certification described in paragraph (4) of this subsection to the Customs Service.
                (C)

A copy of the certification described in paragraph (4) above and a copy of the notification described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph shall be affixed to the complaint for forfeiture.

§ 1312. Bonded smelting and refining warehouses
    Bond; charges against bond
        (a)
        Bond; charges against bond
            Any plant engaged in smelting or refining, or both, of metal-bearing materials as defined in this section may, upon the giving of satisfactory bond, be designated a bonded smelting or refining warehouse. Metal-bearing materials may be entered into a bonded smelting or refining warehouse without the payment of duties thereon and there smelted or refined, or both, together with metal-bearing materials of domestic or foreign origin. Upon arrival of imported metal-bearing materials at the warehouse they shall be sampled according to commercial methods and assayed, both under customs supervision. The bond shall be charged with a sum equal in amount to the duties which would be payable on such metal-bearing materials in their condition as imported if entered for consumption, and the bond charge shall be adjusted to reflect changes in the applicable rate of duty occurring while the imported materials are still covered by the bond.
    Cancellation of charges against bond

        Change of classification or duties
            In order to put into force and effect the policy of Congress by this chapter intended, the commission (1) upon request of the President, or (2) upon resolution of either or both Houses of Congress, or (3) upon its own motion, or (4) when in the judgment of the commission there is good and sufficient reason therefor, upon application of any interested party, shall investigate the differences in the costs of production of any domestic article and of any like or similar foreign article. In the course of the investigation the commission shall hold hearings and give reasonable public notice thereof, and shall afford reasonable opportunity for parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard at such hearings. The commission shall report to the President the results of the investigation and its findings with respect to such differences in costs of production. If the commission finds it shown by the investigation that the duties expressly fixed by statute do not equalize the differences in the costs of production of the domestic article and the like or similar foreign article when produced in the principal competing country, the commission shall specify in its report such increases or decreases in rates of duty expressly fixed by statute (including any necessary change in classification) as it finds shown by the investigation to be necessary to equalize such differences. In no case shall the total increase or decrease of such rates of duty exceed 50 per centum of the rates expressly fixed by statute.

Whenever it is provided in any paragraph of Subtitle I of this chapter, or in any amendatory act, that the duty or duties shall not exceed a specified ad valorem rate upon the articles provided for in such paragraph, no rate determined under the provisions of this section upon such articles shall exceed the maximum ad valorem rate so specified.

            The Commission shall investigate any alleged violation of this section on complaint under oath or upon its initiative. Upon commencing any such investigation, the Commission shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register. The Commission shall conclude any such investigation and make its determination under this section at the earliest practicable time after the date of publication of notice of such investigation. To promote expeditious adjudication, the Commission shall, within 45 days after an investigation is initiated, establish a target date for its final determination.
            (2)
            During the course of each investigation under this section, the Commission shall consult with, and seek advice and information from, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and such other departments and agencies as it considers appropriate.
            (3)
            Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this section, the Commission has reason to believe, based on information before it, that a matter, in whole or in part, may come within the purview of part II of subtitle IV of this chapter, it shall promptly notify the Secretary of Commerce so that such action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by such part II. If the Commission has reason to believe that the matter before it (A) is based solely on alleged acts and effects which are within the purview of section 1671 or 1673 of this title, or (B) relates to an alleged copyright infringement with respect to which action is prohibited by

        Determinations; review
            The Commission shall determine, with respect to each investigation conducted by it under this section, whether or not there is a violation of this section, except that the Commission may, by issuing a consent order or on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to the investigation, including an agreement to present the matter for arbitration, terminate any such investigation, in whole or in part, without making such a determination. Each determination under subsection (d) or (e) shall be made on the record after notice and opportunity for a hearing in conformity with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. All legal and equitable defenses may be presented in all cases. A respondent may raise any counterclaim in a manner prescribed by the Commission. Immediately after a counterclaim is received by the Commission, the respondent raising such counterclaim shall file a notice of removal with a United States district court in which venue for any of the counterclaims raised by the party would exist under
                section 1391 of title 28

    Exclusion of articles from entry
        (d)
        Exclusion of articles from entry
            (1)
            If the Commission determines, as a result of an investigation under this section, that there is a violation of this section, it shall direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person violating the provision of this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry.
            (2)
            The authority of the Commission to order an exclusion from entry of articles shall be limited to persons determined by the Commission to be violating this section unless the Commission determines that—
                (A)
                a general exclusion from entry of articles is necessary to prevent circumvention of an exclusion order limited to products of named persons; or
                (B)
                there is a pattern of violation of this section and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing products.
    Exclusion of articles from entry during investigation except under bond; procedures applicable; preliminary relief
        (e)
        Exclusion of articles from entry during investigation except under bond; procedures applicable; preliminary relief
            (1)
            If, during the course of an investigation under this section, the Commission determines that there is reason to believe that there is a violation of this section, it may direct that the articles concerned, imported by any person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that such person is violating this section, be excluded from entry into the United States, unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such articles should not be excluded from entry. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its action under this subsection directing such exclusion from entry, and upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary shall, through the proper officers, refuse such entry, except that such articles shall be entitled to entry under bond prescribed by the Secretary in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the complainant.
            (2)
            A complainant may petition the Commission for the issuance of an order under this subsection. The Commission shall make a determination with regard to such petition by no later than the 90th day after the date on which the Commission’s notice of investigation is published in the Federal Register. The Commission may extend the 90-day period for an additional 60 days in a case it designates as a more complicated case. The Commission shall publish in the Federal Register its reasons why it designated the case as being more complicated. The Commission may require the complainant to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent.
            (3)
            The Commission may grant preliminary relief under this subsection or subsection (f) to the same extent as preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders may be granted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
            (4)
            The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which bonds may be forfeited under paragraphs (1) and (2).
    Cease and desist orders; civil penalty for violation of orders
        (f)
        Cease and desist orders; civil penalty for violation of orders
            (1)
            In addition to, or in lieu of, taking action under subsection (d) or (e), the Commission may issue and cause to be served on any person violating this section, or believed to be violating this section, as the case may be, an order directing such person to cease and desist from engaging in the unfair methods or acts involved, unless after considering the effect of such order upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, it finds that such order should not be issued. The Commission may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it deems proper, modify or revoke any such order, and, in the case of a revocation, may take action under subsection (d) or (e), as the case may be. If a temporary cease and desist order is issued in addition to, or in lieu of, an exclusion order under subsection (e), the Commission may require the complainant to post a bond, in an amount determined by the Commission to be sufficient to protect the respondent from any injury, as a prerequisite to the issuance of an order under this subsection. If the Commission later determines that the respondent has not violated the provisions of this section, the bond may be forfeited to the respondent. The Commission shall prescribe the terms and conditions under which the bonds may be forfeited under this paragraph.
            (2)
            Any person who violates an order issued by the Commission under paragraph (1) after it has become final shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty for each day on which an importation of articles, or their sale, occurs in violation of the order of not more than the greater of $100,000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold on such day in violation of the order. Such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered for the United States in a civil action brought by the Commission in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation occurs. In such actions, the United States district courts may issue mandatory injunctions incorporating the relief sought by the Commission as they deem appropriate in the enforcement of such final orders of the Commission.

                (B)
                the complaint and a notice of investigation are served on the person;
                (C)

                (D)
                the person fails to show good cause why the person should not be found in default; and
                (E)
                the complainant seeks relief limited solely to that person;
            the Commission shall presume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and shall, upon request, issue an exclusion from entry or a cease and desist order, or both, limited to that person unless, after considering the effect of such exclusion or order upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and United States consumers, the Commission finds that such exclusion or order should not be issued.
            (2)
            In addition to the authority of the Commission to issue a general exclusion from entry of articles when a respondent appears to contest an investigation concerning a violation of the provisions of this section, a general exclusion from entry of articles, regardless of the source or importer of the articles, may be issued if—
                (A)
                no person appears to contest an investigation concerning a violation of the provisions of this section,
                (B)
                such a violation is established by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence, and
                (C)
                the requirements of subsection (d)(2) are met.
    Sanctions for abuse of discovery and abuse of process
        (h)
        Sanctions for abuse of discovery and abuse of process
            The Commission may by rule prescribe sanctions for abuse of discovery and abuse of process to the extent authorized by Rule 11 and Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

        Forfeiture
            (1)
            In addition to taking action under subsection (d), the Commission may issue an order providing that any article imported in violation of the provisions of this section be seized and forfeited to the United States if—
                (A)
                the owner, importer, or consignee of the article previously attempted to import the article into the United States;
                (B)
                the article was previously denied entry into the United States by reason of an order issued under subsection (d); and
                (C)
                upon such previous denial of entry, the Secretary of the Treasury provided the owner, importer, or consignee of the article written notice of—
                    (i)
                    such order, and
                    (ii)
                    the seizure and forfeiture that would result from any further attempt to import the article into the United States.
            (2)
            The Commission shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of any order issued under this subsection and, upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary of the Treasury shall enforce such order in accordance with the provisions of this section.
            (3)
            Upon the attempted entry of articles subject to an order issued under this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury shall immediately notify all ports of entry of the attempted importation and shall identify the persons notified under paragraph (1)(C).

        Exclusion from importation
            If at any time the President shall find it to be a fact that any foreign country has not only discriminated against the commerce of the United States, as aforesaid, but has, after the issuance of a proclamation as authorized in subdivision (a) of this section, maintained or increased its said discriminations against the commerce of the United States, the President is authorized, if he deems it consistent with the interests of the United States, to issue a further proclamation directing that such products of said country or such articles imported in its vessels as he shall deem consistent with the public interests shall be excluded from importation into the United States.

                The transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable for the purposes of this subsection if an examination of the circumstances of the sale of the imported merchandise indicates that the relationship between such buyer and seller did not influence the price actually paid or payable; or if the transaction value of the imported merchandise closely approximates—
                    (i)
                    the transaction value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise, in sales to unrelated buyers in the United States; or
                    (ii)
                    the deductive value or computed value for identical merchandise or similar merchandise;
                but only if each value referred to in clause (i) or (ii) that is used for comparison relates to merchandise that was exported to the United States at or about the same time as the imported merchandise.
                (C)
                In applying the values used for comparison purposes under subparagraph (B), there shall be taken into account differences with respect to the sales involved (if such differences are based on sufficient information whether supplied by the buyer or otherwise available to the customs officer concerned) in—

                    the costs, commissions, values, fees, and proceeds described in paragraph (1); and
                    (iv)
                    the costs incurred by the seller in sales in which he and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in which he and the buyer are related.
            (3)
            The transaction value of imported merchandise does not include any of the following, if identified separately from the price actually paid or payable and from any cost or other item referred to in paragraph (1):
                (A)
                Any reasonable cost or charge that is incurred for—
                    (i)
                    the construction, erection, assembly, or maintenance of, or the technical assistance provided with respect to, the merchandise after its importation into the United States; or
                    (ii)
                    the transportation of the merchandise after such importation.
                (B)
                The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the imported merchandise by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, such merchandise for which vendors in the United States are ordinarily liable.
            (4)
            For purposes of this subsection—
                (A)
                The term “price actually paid or payable” means the total payment (whether direct or indirect, and exclusive of any costs, charges, or expenses incurred for transportation, insurance, and related services incident to the international shipment of the merchandise from the country of exportation to the place of importation in the United States) made, or to be made, for imported merchandise by the buyer to, or for the benefit of, the seller.
                (B)
                Any rebate of, or other decrease in, the price actually paid or payable that is made or otherwise effected between the buyer and seller after the date of the importation of the merchandise into the United States shall be disregarded in determining the transaction value under paragraph (1).
    Transaction value of identical merchandise and similar merchandise
        (c)
        Transaction value of identical merchandise and similar merchandise
            (1)
            The transaction value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise, is the transaction value (acceptable as the appraised value for purposes of this chapter under subsection (b) but adjusted under paragraph (2) of this subsection) of imported merchandise that is—
                (A)

            (2)
            Transaction values determined under this subsection shall be based on sales of identical merchandise or similar merchandise, as the case may be, at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity as the sales of the merchandise being appraised. If no such sale is found, sales of identical merchandise or similar merchandise at either a different commercial level or in different quantities, or both, shall be used, but adjusted to take account of any such difference. Any adjustment made under this paragraph shall be based on sufficient information. If in applying this paragraph with respect to any imported merchandise, two or more transaction values for identical merchandise, or for similar merchandise, are determined, such imported merchandise shall be appraised on the basis of the lower or lowest of such values.

                    (iii)
                    If the merchandise concerned was not sold in the condition as imported and not sold before the close of the 90th day after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise being appraised, after further processing, is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity before the 180th day after the date of such importation.

                    (i)
                    the deduction made for profits and general expenses shall be based upon the importer’s profits and general expenses, unless such profits and general expenses are inconsistent with those reflected in sales in the United States of imported merchandise of the same class or kind, in which case the deduction shall be based on the usual profit and general expenses reflected in such sales, as determined from sufficient information; and
                    (ii)
                    any State or local tax imposed on the importer with respect to the sale of imported merchandise shall be treated as a general expense.

                The price determined under paragraph (2) shall be increased (but only to the extent that such costs are not otherwise included) by an amount equal to the packing costs incurred by the importer or the buyer, as the case may be, with respect to the merchandise concerned.
                (D)

                Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations providing for the transmission to the Customs Service, through an electronic data interchange system, of information pertaining to cargo to be brought into the United States or to be sent from the United States, prior to the arrival or departure of the cargo.
                (B)
                The Secretary shall endeavor to promulgate an initial set of regulations under subparagraph (A) not later than
                    October 1, 2003
        Information required
            (2)
            Information required
                The cargo information required by the regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) under the parameters set forth in paragraph (3) shall be such information on cargo as the Secretary determines to be reasonably necessary to ensure cargo safety and security pursuant to those laws enforced and administered by the Customs Service. The Secretary shall provide to appropriate Federal departments and agencies cargo information obtained pursuant to paragraph (1).
        Parameters
            (3)
            Parameters
            In developing regulations pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adhere to the following parameters:
                (A)
                The Secretary shall solicit comments from and consult with a broad range of parties likely to be affected by the regulations, including importers, exporters, carriers, customs brokers, and freight forwarders, among other interested parties.
                (B)
                In general, the requirement to provide particular information shall be imposed on the party most likely to have direct knowledge of that information. Where requiring information from the party with direct knowledge of that information is not practicable, the regulations shall take into account how, under ordinary commercial practices, information is acquired by the party on which the requirement is imposed, and whether and how such party is able to verify the information. Where information is not reasonably verifiable by the party on which a requirement is imposed, the regulations shall permit that party to transmit information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to be true.
                (C)
                The Secretary shall take into account the existence of competitive relationships among the parties on which requirements to provide particular information are imposed.
                (D)
                Where the regulations impose requirements on carriers of cargo, they shall take into account differences among different modes of transportation, including differences in commercial practices, operational characteristics, and technological capacity to collect and transmit information electronically.
                (E)
                The regulations shall take into account the extent to which the technology necessary for parties to transmit and the Customs Service to receive and analyze data in a timely fashion is available. To the extent that the Secretary determines that the necessary technology will not be widely available to particular modes of transportation or other affected parties until after promulgation of the regulations, the regulations shall provide interim requirements appropriate for the technology that is available at the time of promulgation.
                (F)
                The information collected pursuant to the regulations shall be used exclusively for ensuring cargo safety and security, preventing smuggling, and commercial risk assessment targeting, and shall not be used for any commercial enforcement purposes, including for determining merchandise entry. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this section shall be treated as amending, repealing, or otherwise modifying title IV of the Tariff Act of 1930 [
                    19 U.S.C. 1401
                (G)
                The regulations shall protect the privacy of business proprietary and any other confidential cargo information provided to the Customs Service pursuant to such regulations, except for the manifest information collected pursuant to section 431 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [
                    19 U.S.C. 1431
                    1
                        1
                (H)
                In determining the timing for transmittal of any information, the Secretary shall balance likely impact on flow of commerce with impact on cargo safety and security. With respect to requirements that may be imposed on carriers of cargo, the timing for transmittal of information shall take into account differences among different modes of transportation, as described in subparagraph (D).
                (I)
                Where practicable, the regulations shall avoid imposing requirements that are redundant with one another or that are redundant with requirements in other provisions of law.
                (J)
                The Secretary shall determine whether it is appropriate to provide transition periods between promulgation of the regulations and the effective date of the regulations and shall prescribe such transition periods in the regulations, as appropriate. The Secretary may determine that different transition periods are appropriate for different classes of affected parties.
                (K)
                    (i)
                    The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring the United States Postal Service to transmit the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection for international mail shipments by the Postal Service (including shipments to the Postal Service from foreign postal operators that are transported by private carrier) consistent with the requirements of this subparagraph.
                    (ii)
                    In prescribing regulations under clause (i), the Secretary shall impose requirements for the transmission to the Commissioner of information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for mail shipments described in clause (i) that are comparable to the requirements for the transmission of such information imposed on similar non-mail shipments of cargo, taking into account the parameters set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (J).
                    (iii)
                    The regulations prescribed under clause (i) shall require the transmission of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to a shipment as soon as practicable in relation to the transportation of the shipment, consistent with subparagraph (H).
                    (iv)
                    Regulations prescribed under clause (i) shall allow for the requirements for the transmission to the Commissioner of information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for mail shipments described in clause (i) to be implemented in phases, as appropriate, by—
                        (I)
                        setting incremental targets for increasing the percentage of such shipments for which information is required to be transmitted to the Commissioner; and
                        (II)
                        taking into consideration—
                            (aa)
                            the risk posed by such shipments;
                            (bb)
                            the volume of mail shipped to the United States by or through a particular country; and
                            (cc)
                            the capacities of foreign postal operators to provide that information to the Postal Service.
                    (v)
                        (I)
                        Notwithstanding clause (iv), the Postal Service shall, not later than
                            December 31, 2018
                        (II)
                        If the requirements of subclause (I) are not met, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees, not later than
                            June 30, 2019
                            (aa)
                            assessing the reasons for the failure to meet those requirements; and
                            (bb)
                            identifying recommendations to improve the collection by the Postal Service of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
                    (vi)
                        (I)

                            December 31, 2020
                        (II)
                        The Commissioner, in consultation with the Postmaster General, may determine to exclude a country from the requirement described in subclause (I) to transmit information for mail shipments described in clause (i) from the country if the Commissioner determines that the country—
                            (aa)
                            does not have the capacity to collect and transmit such information;
                            (bb)
                            represents a low risk for mail shipments that violate relevant United States laws and regulations; and
                            (cc)
                            accounts for low volumes of mail shipments that can be effectively screened for compliance with relevant United States laws and regulations through an alternate means.
                        (III)
                        The Commissioner shall, at a minimum on an annual basis, re-evaluate any determination made under subclause (II) to exclude a country from the requirement described in subclause (I). If, at any time, the Commissioner determines that a country no longer meets the requirements under subclause (II), the Commissioner may not further exclude the country from the requirement described in subclause (I).
                        (IV)
                        The Commissioner shall, on an annual basis, submit to the appropriate congressional committees—

                            (bb)

                        The Postmaster General shall, in consultation with the Commissioner, refuse any shipments received after
                            December 31, 2020
                        (II)
                        If remedial action is warranted in lieu of refusal of shipments pursuant to subclause (I), the Postmaster General and the Commissioner shall take remedial action with respect to the shipments, including destruction, seizure, controlled delivery or other law enforcement initiatives, or correction of the failure to provide the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to the shipments.
                        (III)
                        Notwithstanding subclause (I), during the period beginning on

                    (viii)

            The Customs Service shall establish and implement a procedure, under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for accrediting private laboratories within the United States which may be used to perform tests (that would otherwise be performed by Customs Service laboratories) to establish the characteristics, quantities, or composition of imported merchandise. Such regulations—
                (A)
                shall establish the conditions required for the laboratories to receive and maintain accreditation for purposes of this subsection;
                (B)
                shall establish the conditions regarding the suspension and revocation of accreditation, which may include the imposition of a monetary penalty not to exceed $100,000 and such penalty is in addition to the recovery, from a gauger or laboratory accredited under paragraph (1), of any loss of revenue that may have occurred, but the Customs Service—
                    (i)
                    may seek to recover lost revenue only in cases where the gauger or laboratory intentionally falsified the analysis or gauging report in collusion with the importer; and
                    (ii)
                    shall neither assess penalties nor seek to recover lost revenue because of a good faith difference of professional opinion; and
                (C)
                may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge for accreditation and periodic reaccreditation.
            The collection of any charge for accreditation and reaccreditation under this section is not prohibited by

                When requested by an importer of record of merchandise, the Customs Service shall authorize the release to the importer of a representative sample of the merchandise for testing, at the expense of the importer, by a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1). The testing results from a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1) that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry shall, in the absence of testing results obtained from a Customs Service laboratory, be accepted by the Customs Service if the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit in any way or preclude the authority of the Customs Service to test or analyze any sample or merchandise independently.

The results and test description shall be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.
        Seizure and forfeiture
            (4)

            then notice of such summons shall be given to any persons so identified within a reasonable time before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which such records are to be examined or testimony given.

                    (i)

                (A)
                an industry in the United States—

        Time for Commission determination
            (2)
            Time for Commission determination

                    (ii)
                    a developing country with respect to which the Trade Representative has notified the administering authority that the country has eliminated its export subsidies on an expedited basis within the meaning of Article 27.11 of the Subsidies Agreement,

                        (II)
                        the date on which the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that such country is providing an export subsidy.
            (5)
                Notification of article 8 violation
            If the only subsidy under investigation is a subsidy with respect to which the administering authority received notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting “60 days” for “65 days”.

                    (i)
                    the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of—

                        the novelty of the issues presented;
                        (III)
                        the need to determine the extent to which particular countervailable subsidies are used by individual manufacturers, producers, and exporters; or
                        (IV)
                        the number of firms whose activities must be investigated; and

            (2)
            Critical circumstances determinations
            If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under
                section 1671b(e) of this title
                (A)

                there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.

                    (i)
                    is materially injured, or
                    (ii)
                    is threatened with material injury, or
                (B)
                the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,
            by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a). If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.
        Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority

                        section 1671e of this title
                    (ii)

                        any rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and
                        (III)
                        any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the countervailing duty order will be seriously undermined.
                (B)
                If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of that merchandise.

                (B)
                shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated weighted average dumping margin or the estimated all-others rate, whichever is applicable,

                    the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there was likely to be material injury by reason of such sales, and
                (B)
                there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.

The administering authority shall include with such notification the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based. Not later than 5 days after the date on which the determination is required to be made under subsection (a)(2), the Commission shall transmit to the administering authority the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based.

                    the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and

                such agreement satisfies the requirements of subsection (d), and
                (B)

                section 1673b(b) of this title
                (A)
                exporters who account for a significant proportion of exports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation, in a proceeding in which the preliminary determination by the administering authority under
                    section 1673b(b) of this title
                (B)
                the petitioner, in a proceeding in which the preliminary determination by the administering authority under

            (3)
            Critical circumstances determinations
            If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under
                section 1673b(e) of this title
                (A)
                    (i)
                    there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or
                    (ii)
                    the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there would be material injury by reason of such sales, and
                (B)
                there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.
            Such findings may be affirmative even though the preliminary determination under

                an industry in the United States—
                    (i)

                    (ii)
                    is threatened with material injury, or
                (B)
                the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,
            by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a)(1). If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.
        Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority

                    If the finding of the administering authority under subsection (a)(3) is affirmative, then the final determination of the Commission shall include a finding as to whether the imports subject to the affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3) are likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the antidumping duty order to be issued under
                        section 1673e of this title
                    (ii)

                        (I)

                        (II)
                        a rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and
                        (III)
                        any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the antidumping order will be seriously undermined.
                (B)
                If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of the imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise.

                the party described in subparagraph (C) provides credible evidence that the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise is significantly less than the amount of such excess specified in the antidumping duty order published under subsection (a); and
                (E)
                the data concerning the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) apply to sales in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and the number of such sales are sufficient to form an adequate basis for comparison.

                        (VI)
                        whether such sales were made on an arms-length basis; and

                    section 1675(a)(4) of this title
        Volume
            (2)
            Volume
            In evaluating the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States. In so doing, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors, including—
                (A)
                any likely increase in production capacity or existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,
                (B)
                existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or likely increases in inventories,
                (C)
                the existence of barriers to the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United States, and
                (D)
                the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products.
        Price
            (3)
            Price
            In evaluating the likely price effects of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether—
                (A)
                there is likely to be significant price underselling by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic like products, and
                (B)
                imports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.
        Impact on the industry
            (4)
            Impact on the industry
            In evaluating the likely impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to—
                (A)
                likely declines in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,
                (B)
                likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment, and
                (C)
                likely negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product.
            The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this paragraph within the context of the business cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.
        Basis for determination
            (5)
            Basis for determination
                The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under this subsection shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the Commission’s determination of whether material injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. In making that determination, the Commission shall consider that the effects of revocation or termination may not be imminent, but may manifest themselves only over a longer period of time.
        Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy
            (6)
            Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy
                In making a determination under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission may consider the magnitude of the margin of dumping or the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy. If a countervailable subsidy is involved the Commission shall consider information regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.
        Cumulation
            (7)
            Cumulation
                For purposes of this subsection, the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which reviews under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market. The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of imports of the subject merchandise in a case in which it determines that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.
        Special rule for regional industries
            (8)
            Special rule for regional industries
                In a review under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title involving a regional industry, the Commission may base its determination on the regional industry defined in the original investigation under this subtitle, another region that satisfies the criteria established in
                    section 1677(4)(C) of this title
                    section 1677(4)(C) of this title

                (B)
                whether any change in the program which gave rise to the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable subsidy.
        Consideration of other factors
            (2)
            Consideration of other factors
            If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider—
                (A)
                programs determined to provide countervailable subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this subtitle, but only to the extent that such programs—
                    (i)
                    can potentially be used by the exporters or producers subject to the review under
                        section 1675(c) of this title
                    (ii)
                    did not exist at the time that the countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted, and
                (B)
                programs newly alleged to provide countervailable subsidies but only to the extent that the administering authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to such programs and with respect to the exporters or producers subject to the review.
        Net countervailable subsidy
            (3)
            Net countervailable subsidy
                The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under
                    section 1671d of this title
                    section 1675 of this title
        Special rule
            (4)

                (A)
                Treatment of zero and de minimis rates
                    A net countervailable subsidy described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy.
            Application of de minimis standards
                (B)
                Application of de minimis standards

                section 1675(c) of this title
                section 1673c of this title
                (A)
                the weighted average dumping margins determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and
                (B)
                the volume of imports of the subject merchandise for the period before and the period after the issuance of the antidumping duty order or acceptance of the suspension agreement.
        Consideration of other factors
            (2)
            Consideration of other factors
                If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider such other price, cost, market, or economic factors as it deems relevant.
        Magnitude of the margin of dumping
            (3)
            Magnitude of the margin of dumping
                The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the magnitude of the margin of dumping that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a margin that was determined under
                    section 1673d of this title
                    section 1675 of this title
        Special rule
            (4)

            Treatment of zero or de minimis margins
                (A)
                Treatment of zero or de minimis margins
                    A dumping margin described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of sales at less than fair value.
            Application of de minimis standards
                (B)
                Application of de minimis standards
                    For purposes of this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under subsections (a) and (b) of

        Industry
        In general
            (A)
            In general
                The term “industry” means the producers as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the product.
        Related parties
            (B)
            Related parties
                (i)
                If a producer of a domestic like product and an exporter or importer of the subject merchandise are related parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the industry.
                (ii)
                For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an exporter or importer shall be considered to be related parties, if—
                    (I)
                    the producer directly or indirectly controls the exporter or importer,

        Regional industries
            (C)
            Regional industries
            In appropriate circumstances, the United States, for a particular product market, may be divided into 2 or more markets and the producers within each market may be treated as if they were a separate industry if—
                (i)

                (ii)
                the demand in that market is not supplied, to any substantial degree, by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the United States.
            In such appropriate circumstances, material injury, the threat of material injury, or material retardation of the establishment of an industry may be found to exist with respect to an industry even if the domestic industry as a whole, or those producers whose collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of that product, is not injured, if there is a concentration of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy into such an isolated market and if the producers of all, or almost all, of the production within that market are being materially injured or threatened by material injury, or if the establishment of an industry is being materially retarded, by reason of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy. The term “regional industry” means the domestic producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry under this subparagraph.

            (D)
            Product lines
                The effect of dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed in relation to the United States production of a domestic like product if available data permit the separate identification of production in terms of such criteria as the production process or the producer’s profits. If the domestic production of the domestic like product has no separate identity in terms of such criteria, then the effect of the dumped imports or imports of merchandise benefiting from a countervailable subsidy shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes a domestic like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.
        Industry producing processed agricultural products
            (E)
            Industry producing processed agricultural products
            In general
                (i)
                In general
                Subject to clause (v), in an investigation involving a processed agricultural product produced from any raw agricultural product, the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product may be considered part of the industry producing the processed product if—
                    (I)
                    the processed agricultural product is produced from the raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production; and
                    (II)
                    there is a substantial coincidence of economic interest between the producers or growers of the raw agricultural product and the processors of the processed agricultural product based upon relevant economic factors, which may, in the discretion of the Commission, include price, added market value, or other economic interrelationships (regardless of whether such coincidence of economic interest is based upon any legal relationship).
            Processing
                (ii)
                Processing
                For purposes of this subparagraph, the processed agricultural product shall be considered to be processed from a raw agricultural product through a single continuous line of production if—
                    (I)
                    the raw agricultural product is substantially or completely devoted to the production of the processed agricultural product; and
                    (II)
                    the processed agricultural product is produced substantially or completely from the raw product.
            Relevant economic factors
                (iii)
                Relevant economic factors
                For purposes of clause (i)(II), in addition to such other factors it considers relevant to the question of coincidence of economic interest, the Commission shall—
                    (I)
                    if price is taken into account, consider the degree of correlation between the price of the raw agricultural product and the price of the processed agricultural product; and
                    (II)
                    if added market value is taken into account, consider whether the value of the raw agricultural product constitutes a significant percentage of the value of the processed agricultural product.
            Raw agricultural product
                (iv)
                Raw agricultural product
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “raw agricultural product” means any farm or fishery product.
            Termination of this subparagraph
                (v)
                Termination of this subparagraph
                    This subparagraph shall cease to have effect if the United States Trade Representative notifies the administering authority and the Commission that the application of this subparagraph is inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States.
    Countervailable subsidy
        (5)
        Countervailable subsidy
        In general
            (A)
            In general
                Except as provided in paragraph (5B), a countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in this paragraph which is specific as described in paragraph (5A).
        Subsidy described
            (B)
            Subsidy described
            A subsidy is described in this paragraph in the case in which an authority—
                (i)
                provides a financial contribution,
                (ii)
                provides any form of income or price support within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or
                (iii)
                makes a payment to a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a private entity to make a financial contribution, if providing the contribution would normally be vested in the government and the practice does not differ in substance from practices normally followed by governments,
            to a person and a benefit is thereby conferred. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (5A) and (5B), the term “authority” means a government of a country or any public entity within the territory of the country.
        Other factors
            (C)
            Other factors
                The determination of whether a subsidy exists shall be made without regard to whether the recipient of the subsidy is publicly or privately owned and without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of merchandise. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining whether a subsidy exists under this paragraph.
        Financial contribution
            (D)
            Financial contribution
            The term “financial contribution” means—
                (i)
                the direct transfer of funds, such as grants, loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees,
                (ii)
                foregoing or not collecting revenue that is otherwise due, such as granting tax credits or deductions from taxable income,
                (iii)
                providing goods or services, other than general infrastructure, or
                (iv)
                purchasing goods.
        Benefit conferred
            (E)
            Benefit conferred
            A benefit shall normally be treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient, including—
                (i)
                in the case of an equity infusion, if the investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors, including the practice regarding the provision of risk capital, in the country in which the equity infusion is made,
                (ii)
                in the case of a loan, if there is a difference between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on the market,
                (iii)
                in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no guarantee by the authority, and
                (iv)
                in the case where goods or services are provided, if such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.
            For purposes of clause (iv), the adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions for the good or service being provided or the goods being purchased in the country which is subject to the investigation or review. Prevailing market conditions include price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and other conditions of purchase or sale.
        Change in ownership
            (F)
            Change in ownership
                A change in ownership of all or part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination by the administering authority that a past countervailable subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be countervailable, even if the change in ownership is accomplished through an arm’s length transaction.
    Specificity
        (5A)
        Specificity
        In general
            (A)
            In general
                A subsidy is specific if it is an export subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).
        Export subsidy
            (B)
            Export subsidy
                An export subsidy is a subsidy that is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.
        Import substitution subsidy
            (C)
            Import substitution subsidy
                An import substitution subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.
        Domestic subsidy
            (D)
            Domestic subsidy
            In determining whether a subsidy (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, to an enterprise or industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:
                (i)
                Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enterprise or industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.
                (ii)
                Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy is not specific as a matter of law, if—
                    (I)
                    eligibility is automatic,
                    (II)
                    the criteria or conditions for eligibility are strictly followed, and
                    (III)
                    the criteria or conditions are clearly set forth in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.
            For purposes of this clause, the term “objective criteria or conditions” means criteria or conditions that are neutral and that do not favor one enterprise or industry over another.
                (iii)
                Where there are reasons to believe that a subsidy may be specific as a matter of fact, the subsidy is specific if one or more of the following factors exist:
                    (I)
                    The actual recipients of the subsidy, whether considered on an enterprise or industry basis, are limited in number.
                    (II)
                    An enterprise or industry is a predominant user of the subsidy.
                    (III)
                    An enterprise or industry receives a disproportionately large amount of the subsidy.
                    (IV)
                    The manner in which the authority providing the subsidy has exercised discretion in the decision to grant the subsidy indicates that an enterprise or industry is favored over others.
            In evaluating the factors set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), and (IV), the administering authority shall take into account the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, and the length of time during which the subsidy program has been in operation.
                (iv)
                Where a subsidy is limited to an enterprise or industry located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the subsidy, the subsidy is specific.
        For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to an enterprise or industry is a reference to a foreign enterprise or foreign industry and includes a group of such enterprises or industries.
    Categories of noncountervailable subsidies
        (5B)
        Categories of noncountervailable subsidies
        In general
            (A)
            In general
                Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (5A), in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, a subsidy shall be treated as noncountervailable if the administering authority determines in an investigation under part I of this subtitle or a review under part III of this subtitle that the subsidy meets all of the criteria described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, or the provisions of subparagraph (E)(i) apply.

                Except for a subsidy provided on the manufacture, production, or export of civil aircraft, a subsidy for research activities conducted by a person, or by a higher education or research establishment on a contract basis with a person, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 percent of the costs of industrial research or not more than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to—
                    (I)
                    the costs of researchers, technicians, and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity,

                    (III)
                    the costs of consultancy and equivalent services used exclusively for the research activity, including costs for bought-in research, technical knowledge, and patents,
                    (IV)
                    additional overhead costs incurred directly as a result of the research activity, and

                A subsidy provided, pursuant to a general framework of regional development, to a person located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible regions and if the following conditions are met:
                    (I)
                    Each region identified as disadvantaged within the territory of a country is a clearly designated, contiguous geographical area with a definable economic and administrative identity.
                    (II)
                    Each region is considered a disadvantaged region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, or other official document so as to be capable of verification.
                    (III)
                    The criteria described in subclause (II) include a measurement of economic development.
                    (IV)
                    Programs provided within a general framework of regional development include ceilings on the amount of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in paragraph (5A)(D).
            Measurement of economic development
                (ii)
                Measurement of economic development
                For purposes of clause (i), the measurement of economic development shall be based on one or more of the following factors:
                    (I)
                    Per capita income, household per capita income, or per capita gross domestic product that does not exceed 85 percent of the average for the country subject to investigation or review.
                    (II)
                    An unemployment rate that is at least 110 percent of the average unemployment rate for the country subject to investigation or review.
            The measurement of economic development shall cover a 3-year period, but may be a composite measurement and may include factors other than those set forth in this clause.
            Definitions

                In general
                A subsidy that is provided to promote the adaptation of existing facilities to new environmental requirements that are imposed by statute or by regulation, and that result in greater constraints and financial burdens on the recipient of the subsidy, shall be treated as noncountervailable, if the subsidy—
                    (I)
                    is a one-time nonrecurring measure,
                    (II)

                    (IV)
                    is directly linked and proportionate to the recipient’s planned reduction of nuisances and pollution, and does not cover any manufacturing cost savings that may be achieved, and
                    (V)
                    is available to all persons that can adopt the new equipment or production processes.

                    (II)
                    the subsidy is specific within the meaning of paragraph (5A).

        Volume and consequent impact
            (B)
            Volume and consequent impact
            In making determinations under sections 1671b(a), 1671d(b), 1673b(a), and 1673d(b) of this title, the Commission, in each case—
                (i)
                shall consider—
                    (I)
                    the volume of imports of the subject merchandise,
                    (II)
                    the effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the United States for domestic like products, and
                    (III)
                    the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of domestic like products, but only in the context of production operations within the United States; and
                (ii)
                may consider such other economic factors as are relevant to the determination regarding whether there is material injury by reason of imports.
            In the notification required under section 1671d(d) or 1673d(d) of this title, as the case may be, the Commission shall explain its analysis of each factor considered under clause (i), and identify each factor considered under clause (ii) and explain in full its relevance to the determination.
        Evaluation of relevant factors
            (C)
            Evaluation of relevant factors
            For purposes of subparagraph (B)—
            Volume
                (i)
                Volume
                    In evaluating the volume of imports of merchandise, the Commission shall consider whether the volume of imports of the merchandise, or any increase in that volume, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States, is significant.
            Price
                (ii)
                Price
                In evaluating the effect of imports of such merchandise on prices, the Commission shall consider whether—
                    (I)
                    there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the United States, and
                    (II)
                    the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree.
            Impact on affected domestic industry
                (iii)
                Impact on affected domestic industry
                In examining the impact required to be considered under subparagraph (B)(i)(III), the Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to—
                    (I)
                    actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, gross profits, operating profits, net profits, ability to service debt, productivity, return on investments, return on assets, and utilization of capacity,
                    (II)
                    factors affecting domestic prices,
                    (III)
                    actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment,
                    (IV)
                    actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and
                    (V)
                    in a proceeding under part II of this subtitle, the magnitude of the margin of dumping.
            The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this clause within the context of the business cycle and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.
            Captive production
                (iv)
                Captive production
                If domestic producers internally transfer significant production of the domestic like product for the production of a downstream article and sell significant production of the domestic like product in the merchant market, and the Commission finds that—
                    (I)
                    the domestic like product produced that is internally transferred for processing into that downstream article does not enter the merchant market for the domestic like product, and
                    (II)
                    the domestic like product is the predominant material input in the production of that downstream article,
            then the Commission, in determining market share and the factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the domestic like product.
        Special rules for agricultural products
            (D)
            Special rules for agricultural products
                (i)
                The Commission shall not determine that there is no material injury or threat of material injury to United States producers of an agricultural commodity merely because the prevailing market price is at or above the minimum support price.
                (ii)
                In the case of agricultural products, the Commission shall consider any increased burden on government income or price support programs.
        Special rules
            (E)
            Special rules
            For purposes of this paragraph—
            Nature of countervailable subsidy
                (i)
                Nature of countervailable subsidy
                    In determining whether there is a threat of material injury, the Commission shall consider information provided to it by the administering authority regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy granted by a foreign country (particularly whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement) and the effects likely to be caused by the countervailable subsidy.
            Standard for determination
                (ii)
                Standard for determination
                    The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate under subparagraph (C) or (D) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination by the Commission of material injury.
        Threat of material injury
            (F)
            Threat of material injury
            In general
                (i)
                In general
                In determining whether an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other relevant economic factors—
                    (I)
                    if a countervailable subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to it by the administering authority as to the nature of the subsidy (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the subject merchandise are likely to increase,
                    (II)
                    any existing unused production capacity or imminent, substantial increase in production capacity in the exporting country indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports,
                    (III)
                    a significant rate of increase of the volume or market penetration of imports of the subject merchandise indicating the likelihood of substantially increased imports,
                    (IV)
                    whether imports of the subject merchandise are entering at prices that are likely to have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and are likely to increase demand for further imports,
                    (V)
                    inventories of the subject merchandise,
                    (VI)
                    the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products,
                    (VII)
                    in any investigation under this subtitle which involves imports of both a raw agricultural product (within the meaning of paragraph (4)(E)(iv)) and any product processed from such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there is an affirmative determination by the Commission under section 1671d(b)(1) or 1673d(b)(1) of this title with respect to either the raw agricultural product or the processed agricultural product (but not both),
                    (VIII)
                    the actual and potential negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the domestic industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product, and
                    (IX)
                    any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability that there is likely to be material injury by reason of imports (or sale for importation) of the subject merchandise (whether or not it is actually being imported at the time).
            Basis for determination
                (ii)
                Basis for determination
                    The Commission shall consider the factors set forth in clause (i) as a whole in making a determination of whether further dumped or subsidized imports are imminent and whether material injury by reason of imports would occur unless an order is issued or a suspension agreement is accepted under this subtitle. The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under clause (i) shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the determination. Such a determination may not be made on the basis of mere conjecture or supposition.
            Effect of dumping in third-country markets
                (iii)
                Effect of dumping in third-country markets
                In general
                    (I)
                    In general
                        In investigations under part II of this subtitle, the Commission shall consider whether dumping in the markets of foreign countries (as evidenced by dumping findings or antidumping remedies in other WTO member markets against the same class or kind of merchandise manufactured or exported by the same party as under investigation) suggests a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. In the course of its investigation, the Commission shall request information from the foreign manufacturer, exporter, or United States importer concerning this issue.
                WTO member market
                    (II)
                    WTO member market
                        For purposes of this clause, the term “WTO member market” means the market of any country which is a WTO member.
                European Communities
                    (III)
                    European Communities
                        For purposes of this clause, the European Communities shall be treated as a foreign country.

                    petitions were filed under section 1671a(b) or 1673a(b) of this title and investigations were initiated under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title on the same day,
            if such imports compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.
            Exceptions
                (ii)
                Exceptions
                The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports under clause (i)—
                    (I)
                    with respect to which the administering authority has made a preliminary negative determination, unless the administering authority subsequently made a final affirmative determination with respect to those imports before the Commission’s final determination is made;
                    (II)
                    from any country with respect to which the investigation has been terminated;
                    (III)
                    from any country designated as a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (

                Records in final investigations
                    In each final determination in which it cumulatively assesses the volume and effect of imports under clause (i), the Commission shall make its determinations based on the record compiled in the first investigation in which it makes a final determination, except that when the administering authority issues its final determination in a subsequently completed investigation, the Commission shall permit the parties in the subsequent investigation to submit comments concerning the significance of the administering authority’s final determination, and shall include such comments and the administering authority’s final determination in the record for the subsequent investigation.
            Regional industry determinations
                (iv)
                Regional industry determinations
                    In an investigation which involves a regional industry, and in which the Commission decides that the volume and effect of imports should be cumulatively assessed under this subparagraph, such assessment shall be based upon the volume and effect of imports into the region or regions determined by the Commission. The provisions of clause (iii) shall apply to such investigations.
        Cumulation for determining threat of material injury
            (H)

            (2)
            Adjustments
                If the administering authority has determined in a previous proceeding that a countervailable subsidy is paid or bestowed on the input product that is used for comparison under paragraph (1), the administering authority may (A) where appropriate, adjust the price that the manufacturer or producer of merchandise which is the subject of such proceeding would otherwise pay for the product to reflect the effects of the countervailable subsidy, or (B) select in lieu of that price a price from another source.
    Inclusion of amount of countervailable subsidy
        (c)

    Special rule for merchandise with value added after importation
        (e)
        Special rule for merchandise with value added after importation
        Where the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer, and the value added in the United States by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise, the administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices if there is a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison and the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate:

            The price of identical subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
            (2)
            The price of other subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.

    Determination
        (a)
        Determination
        In determining under this subtitle whether subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value, a fair comparison shall be made between the export price or constructed export price and normal value. In order to achieve a fair comparison with the export price or constructed export price, normal value shall be determined as follows:
        Determination of normal value
            (1)
            Determination of normal value
            In general
                (A)
                In general
                    The normal value of the subject merchandise shall be the price described in subparagraph (B), at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to determine the export price or constructed export price under section 1677a(a) or (b) of this title.
            Price
                (B)
                Price
                The price referred to in subparagraph (A) is—
                    (i)
                    the price at which the foreign like product is first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price, or
                    (ii)
                    in a case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the price at which the foreign like product is so sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the United States, if—
                        (I)
                        such price is representative,
                        (II)
                        the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold by the exporter or producer in such other country is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of the subject merchandise sold in the United States or for export to the United States, and
                        (III)
                        the administering authority does not determine that the particular market situation prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.
            Third country sales
                (C)
                Third country sales
                This subparagraph applies when—
                    (i)
                    the foreign like product is not sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country as described in subparagraph (B)(i),
                    (ii)
                    the administering authority determines that the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country is insufficient to permit a proper comparison with the sales of the subject merchandise to the United States, or
                    (iii)
                    the particular market situation in the exporting country does not permit a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.
                For purposes of clause (ii), the aggregate quantity (or value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country shall normally be considered to be insufficient if such quantity (or value) is less than 5 percent of the aggregate quantity (or value) of sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.
        Fictitious markets
            (2)
            Fictitious markets
                No pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious market, shall be taken into account in determining normal value. The occurrence of different movements in the prices at which different forms of the foreign like product are sold (or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale) in the exporting country after the issuance of an antidumping duty order may be considered by the administering authority as evidence of the establishment of a fictitious market for the foreign like product if the movement in such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the subject merchandise.
        Exportation from an intermediate country
            (3)
            Exportation from an intermediate country
            Where the subject merchandise is exported to the United States from an intermediate country, normal value shall be determined in the intermediate country, except that normal value may be determined in the country of origin of the subject merchandise if—
                (A)
                the producer knew at the time of the sale that the subject merchandise was destined for exportation;
                (B)
                the subject merchandise is merely transshipped through the intermediate country;
                (C)
                sales of the foreign like product in the intermediate country do not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1)(C); or
                (D)
                the foreign like product is not produced in the intermediate country.
        Use of constructed value
            (4)
            Use of constructed value
                If the administering authority determines that the normal value of the subject merchandise cannot be determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i), then, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the normal value of the subject merchandise may be the constructed value of that merchandise, as determined under subsection (e).
        Indirect sales or offers for sale
            (5)
            Indirect sales or offers for sale
                If the foreign like product is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale through an affiliated party, the prices at which the foreign like product is sold (or offered for sale) by such affiliated party may be used in determining normal value.
        Adjustments
            (6)
            Adjustments
            The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be—
                (A)
                increased by the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States;
                (B)
                reduced by—
                    (i)
                    when included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser,
                    (ii)
                    the amount, if any, included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), attributable to any additional costs, charges, and expenses incident to bringing the foreign like product from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser, and
                    (iii)
                    the amount of any taxes imposed directly upon the foreign like product or components thereof which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, on the subject merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of the foreign like product, and
                (C)
                increased or decreased by the amount of any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise provided under this section) that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to—
                    (i)
                    the fact that the quantities in which the subject merchandise is sold or agreed to be sold to the United States are greater than or less than the quantities in which the foreign like product is sold, agreed to be sold, or offered for sale,
                    (ii)
                    the fact that merchandise described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of
                        section 1677(16) of this title
                    (iii)
                    other differences in the circumstances of sale.
        Additional adjustments
            (7)
            Additional adjustments
            Level of trade
                (A)
                Level of trade
                The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall also be increased or decreased to make due allowance for any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise made under this section) that is shown to be wholly or partly due to a difference in level of trade between the export price or constructed export price and normal value, if the difference in level of trade—
                    (i)
                    involves the performance of different selling activities; and
                    (ii)
                    is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.
                In a case described in the preceding sentence, the amount of the adjustment shall be based on the price differences between the two levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.
            Constructed export price offset
                (B)
                Constructed export price offset
                    When normal value is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the constructed export price, but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under
                        section 1677a(d)(1)(D) of this title
        Adjustments to constructed value
            (8)

        (b)
        Sales at less than cost of production
        Determination; sales disregarded
            (1)
            Determination; sales disregarded
            Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of that product, the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production. If the administering authority determines that sales made at less than the cost of production—
                (A)
                have been made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities, and
                (B)
                were not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time,
            such sales may be disregarded in the determination of normal value. Whenever such sales are disregarded, normal value shall be based on the remaining sales of the foreign like product in the ordinary course of trade. If no sales made in the ordinary course of trade remain, the normal value shall be based on the constructed value of the merchandise.

                    The term “extended period of time” means a period that is normally 1 year, but not less than 6 months.
            Substantial quantities
                (C)
                Substantial quantities
                Sales made at prices below the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities if—
                    (i)
                    the volume of such sales represents 20 percent or more of the volume of sales under consideration for the determination of normal value, or
                    (ii)
                    the weighted average per unit price of the sales under consideration for the determination of normal value is less than the weighted average per unit cost of production for such sales.
            Recovery of costs
                (D)
                Recovery of costs
                    If prices which are below the per unit cost of production at the time of sale are above the weighted average per unit cost of production for the period of investigation or review, such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.
        Calculation of cost of production
            (3)
            Calculation of cost of production
            For purposes of this part, the cost of production shall be an amount equal to the sum of—
                (A)
                the cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the foreign like product, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of that foreign like product in the ordinary course of business;
                (B)
                an amount for selling, general, and administrative expenses based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign like product by the exporter in question; and
                (C)
                the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment.
            For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the normal value is based on the price of the foreign like product sold for consumption in a country other than the exporting country, the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation.
    Nonmarket economy countries
        (c)
        Nonmarket economy countries
        In general
            (1)
            In general
            If—
                (A)
                the subject merchandise is exported from a nonmarket economy country, and
                (B)
                the administering authority finds that available information does not permit the normal value of the subject merchandise to be determined under subsection (a),
            the administering authority shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.
        Exception
            (2)
            Exception
            If the administering authority finds that the available information is inadequate for purposes of determining the normal value of subject merchandise under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine the normal value on the basis of the price at which merchandise that is—
                (A)
                comparable to the subject merchandise, and
                (B)
                produced in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country,
            is sold in other countries, including the United States.
        Factors of production
            (3)
            Factors of production
            For purposes of paragraph (1), the factors of production utilized in producing merchandise include, but are not limited to—
                (A)
                hours of labor required,
                (B)
                quantities of raw materials employed,
                (C)
                amounts of energy and other utilities consumed, and
                (D)
                representative capital cost, including depreciation.
        Valuation of factors of production
            (4)
            Valuation of factors of production
            The administering authority, in valuing factors of production under paragraph (1), shall utilize, to the extent possible, the prices or costs of factors of production in one or more market economy countries that are—
                (A)
                at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country, and
                (B)
                significant producers of comparable merchandise.
        Discretion to disregard certain price or cost values
            (5)
            Discretion to disregard certain price or cost values
                In valuing the factors of production under paragraph (1) for the subject merchandise, the administering authority may disregard price or cost values without further investigation if the administering authority has determined that broadly available export subsidies existed or particular instances of subsidization occurred with respect to those price or cost values or if those price or cost values were subject to an antidumping order.
    Special rule for certain multinational corporations
        (d)
        Special rule for certain multinational corporations
        Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this subtitle, the administering authority determines that—
            (1)
            subject merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a person, firm, or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities for the production of the foreign like product which are located in another country or countries,
            (2)
            subsection (a)(1)(C) applies, and
            (3)
            the normal value of the foreign like product produced in one or more of the facilities outside the exporting country is higher than the normal value of the foreign like product produced in the facilities located in the exporting country,
        it shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise by reference to the normal value at which the foreign like product is sold in substantial quantities from one or more facilities outside the exporting country. The administering authority, in making any determination under this paragraph, shall make adjustments for the difference between the cost of production (including taxes, labor, materials, and overhead) of the foreign like product produced in facilities outside the exporting country and costs of production of the foreign like product produced in facilities in the exporting country, if such differences are demonstrated to its satisfaction. For purposes of this subsection, in determining the normal value of the foreign like product produced in a country outside of the exporting country, the administering authority shall determine its price at the time of exportation from the exporting country and shall make any adjustments required by subsection (a) for the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States by reference to such costs in the exporting country.
    Constructed value
        (e)
        Constructed value
        For purposes of this subtitle, the constructed value of imported merchandise shall be an amount equal to the sum of—
            (1)
            the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the merchandise, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of the merchandise in the ordinary course of trade;
            (2)
                (A)
                the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product, in the ordinary course of trade, for consumption in the foreign country, or
                (B)
                if actual data are not available with respect to the amounts described in subparagraph (A), then—
                    (i)
                    the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale, for consumption in the foreign country, of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise,
                    (ii)
                    the weighted average of the actual amounts incurred and realized by exporters or producers that are subject to the investigation or review (other than the exporter or producer described in clause (i)) for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product, in the ordinary course of trade, for consumption in the foreign country, or
                    (iii)
                    the amounts incurred and realized for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, based on any other reasonable method, except that the amount allowed for profit may not exceed the amount normally realized by exporters or producers (other than the exporter or producer described in clause (i)) in connection with the sale, for consumption in the foreign country, of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise; and
            (3)
            the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States.
        For purposes of paragraph (1), if a particular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, the administering authority may use another calculation methodology under this part or any other calculation methodology. For purposes of paragraph (1), the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition that is remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials.
    Special rules for calculation of cost of production and for calculation of constructed value
        (f)
        Special rules for calculation of cost of production and for calculation of constructed value
        For purposes of subsections (b) and (e).—

        Costs
            (1)
            Costs
            In general
                (A)
                In general
                    Costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country (or the producing country, where appropriate) and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise. The administering authority shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer, in particular for establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods, and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.
            Nonrecurring costs
                (B)
                Nonrecurring costs
                    Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those nonrecurring costs that benefit current or future production, or both.
            Startup costs
                (C)
                Startup costs
                In general
                    (i)
                    In general
                        Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for circumstances in which costs incurred during the time period covered by the investigation or review are affected by startup operations.
                Startup operations
                    (ii)
                    Startup operations
                    Adjustments shall be made for startup operations only where—
                        (I)
                        a producer is using new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment, and
                        (II)
                        production levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.
                For purposes of subclause (II), the initial phase of commercial production ends at the end of the startup period. In determining whether commercial production levels have been achieved, the administering authority shall consider factors unrelated to startup operations that might affect the volume of production processed, such as demand, seasonality, or business cycles.
                Adjustment for startup operations
                    (iii)
                    Adjustment for startup operations
                        The adjustment for startup operations shall be made by substituting the unit production costs incurred with respect to the merchandise at the end of the startup period for the unit production costs incurred during the startup period. If the startup period extends beyond the period of the investigation or review under this subtitle, the administering authority shall use the most recent cost of production data that it reasonably can obtain, analyze, and verify without delaying the timely completion of the investigation or review. For purposes of this subparagraph, the startup period ends at the point at which the level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.
        Transactions disregarded
            (2)
            Transactions disregarded
                A transaction directly or indirectly between affiliated persons may be disregarded if, in the case of any element of value required to be considered, the amount representing that element does not fairly reflect the amount usually reflected in sales of merchandise under consideration in the market under consideration. If a transaction is disregarded under the preceding sentence and no other transactions are available for consideration, the determination of the amount shall be based on the information available as to what the amount would have been if the transaction had occurred between persons who are not affiliated.
        Major input rule
            (3)
            Major input rule
                If, in the case of a transaction between affiliated persons involving the production by one of such persons of a major input to the merchandise, the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost of production of such input, then the administering authority may determine the value of the major input on the basis of the information available regarding such cost of production, if such cost is greater than the amount that would be determined for such input under paragraph (2).
§ 1677b–1. Currency conversion
    In general
        (a)
        In general
            In an antidumping proceeding under this subtitle, the administering authority shall convert foreign currencies into United States dollars using the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale of the subject merchandise, except that, if it is established that a currency transaction on forward markets is directly linked to an export sale under consideration, the exchange rate specified with respect to such currency in the forward sale agreement shall be used to convert the foreign currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates shall be ignored.
    Sustained movement in foreign currency value
        (b)
        Sustained movement in foreign currency value
            In an investigation under part II of this subtitle, if there is a sustained movement in the value of the foreign currency relative to the United States dollar, the administering authority shall allow exporters at least 60 days to adjust their export prices to reflect such sustained movement.
§ 1677c. Hearings
    Investigation hearings
        (a)
        Investigation hearings
        In general
            (1)
            In general
                Except as provided in paragraph (2), the administering authority and the Commission shall each hold a hearing in the course of an investigation upon the request of any party to the investigation before making a final determination under section 1671d or 1673d of this title.
        Exception
            (2)
            Exception
                If investigations are initiated under part I and part II of this subtitle regarding the same merchandise from the same country within 6 months of each other (but before a final determination is made in either investigation), the holding of a hearing by the Commission in the course of one of the investigations shall be treated as compliance with paragraph (1) for both investigations, unless the Commission considers that special circumstances require that a hearing be held in the course of each of the investigations. During any investigation regarding which the holding of a hearing is waived under this paragraph, the Commission shall allow any party to submit such additional written comment as it considers relevant.
    Procedures
        (b)
        Procedures
            Any hearing required or permitted under this subtitle shall be conducted after notice published in the Federal Register, and a transcript of the hearing shall be prepared and made available to the public. The hearing shall not be subject to the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, or to section 702 of such title.
§ 1677d. Countervailable subsidy practices discovered during a proceeding
        (1)
        shall include the practice, subsidy, or subsidy program in the proceeding if the practice, subsidy, or subsidy program appears to be a countervailable subsidy with respect to the merchandise which is the subject of the proceeding, or
        (2)
        shall transfer the information (other than confidential information) concerning the practice, subsidy, or subsidy program to the library maintained under

                    section 1677m(i) of this title
        the administering authority and the Commission shall, subject to
            section 1677m(d) of this title
    Adverse inferences
        (b)
        Adverse inferences
        In general
            (1)
            In general
            If the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority or the Commission, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be), in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle—
                (A)
                may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available; and
                (B)
                is not required to determine, or make any adjustments to, a countervailable subsidy rate or weighted average dumping margin based on any assumptions about information the interested party would have provided if the interested party had complied with the request for information.
        Potential sources of information for adverse inferences
            (2)
            Potential sources of information for adverse inferences
            An adverse inference under paragraph (1)(A) may include reliance on information derived from—
                (A)
                the petition,
                (B)
                a final determination in the investigation under this subtitle,
                (C)
                any previous review under

        In general
            (1)
            In general
                Except as provided in paragraph (2), when the administering authority or the Commission relies on secondary information rather than on information obtained in the course of an investigation or review, the administering authority or the Commission, as the case may be, shall, to the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at their disposal.
        Exception
            (2)
            Exception
                The administrative authority and the Commission shall not be required to corroborate any dumping margin or countervailing duty applied in a separate segment of the same proceeding.

        Subsidy rates and dumping margins in adverse inference determinations
        In general
            (1)
            In general
            If the administering authority uses an inference that is adverse to the interests of a party under subsection (b)(1)(A) in selecting among the facts otherwise available, the administering authority may—
                (A)
                in the case of a countervailing duty proceeding—
                    (i)
                    use a countervailable subsidy rate applied for the same or similar program in a countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country; or
                    (ii)
                    if there is no same or similar program, use a countervailable subsidy rate for a subsidy program from a proceeding that the administering authority considers reasonable to use; and
                (B)
                in the case of an antidumping duty proceeding, use any dumping margin from any segment of the proceeding under the applicable antidumping order.
        Discretion to apply highest rate
            (2)
            Discretion to apply highest rate
                In carrying out paragraph (1), the administering authority may apply any of the countervailable subsidy rates or dumping margins specified under that paragraph, including the highest such rate or margin, based on the evaluation by the administering authority of the situation that resulted in the administering authority using an adverse inference in selecting among the facts otherwise available.

                    (ii)

After notification of all parties to the investigation and after an opportunity for a hearing on the record, the court may issue an order, under such conditions as the court deems appropriate, which shall not have the effect of stopping or suspending the investigation, directing the administering authority or the Commission to make all or a portion of the requested information described in the preceding sentence available under a protective order and setting forth sanctions for violation of such order if the court finds that, under the standards applicable in proceedings of the court, such an order is warranted, and that—
                (A)

                (B)
                the person on whose behalf the information is requested is an interested party who is a party to the investigation in connection with which the information was obtained or developed, and
                (C)
                the party which submitted the information to which the request relates has been notified, in advance of the hearing, of the request made under this section and of its right to appear and be heard.

            Any party submitting written information, including business proprietary information, to the administering authority or the Commission during a proceeding shall, at the same time, serve the information upon all interested parties who are parties to the proceeding, if the information is covered by a protective order. The administering authority or the Commission shall not accept any such information that is not accompanied by a certificate of service and a copy of the protective order version of the document containing the information.

                (B)
                Exception
                The administering authority may determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise, if—
                    (i)
                    there is a pattern of export prices (or constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time, and

                (B)
                such countervailable subsidy has been demonstrated to have reduced the average price of imports of the class or kind of merchandise during the relevant period, and
                (C)
                the administering authority can reasonably estimate the extent to which the countervailable subsidy referred to in subparagraph (B), in combination with the use of normal value determined pursuant to
                    section 1677b(c) of this title
            the administering authority shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), reduce the antidumping duty by the amount of the increase in the weighted average dumping margin estimated by the administering authority under subparagraph (C).

            Exclusion from orders
            The administering authority may not exclude a later-developed merchandise from a countervailing or antidumping duty order merely because the merchandise—

    Congressional findings; directives; disavowal of prior approval of legislation
        (a)
        Congressional findings; directives; disavowal of prior approval of legislation
            The Congress finds that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade are reducing the growth of foreign markets for the products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, diminishing the intended mutual benefits of reciprocal trade concessions, adversely affecting the United States economy, preventing fair and equitable access to supplies, and preventing the development of open and nondiscriminatory trade among nations. The President is urged to take all appropriate and feasible steps within his power (including the full exercise of the rights of the United States under international agreements) to harmonize, reduce, or eliminate such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. The President is further urged to utilize the authority granted by subsection (b) to negotiate trade agreements with other countries and instrumentalities providing on a basis of mutuality for the harmonization, reduction, or elimination of such barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prior approval of any legislation which may be necessary to implement an agreement concerning barriers to (or other distortions of) international trade.

                The negotiation of any trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) with Israel that provides for the elimination or reduction of any duty imposed by the United States shall take fully into account any product that benefits from a discriminatory preferential tariff arrangement between Israel and a third country if the tariff preference on such product has been the subject of a challenge by the United States Government under the authority of
                    section 2411 of this title
                (C)

            (1)
            to deal with large and persistent United States balance-of-trade surpluses, as determined on the basis of the cost-insurance-freight value of imports, as reported by the Bureau of the Census, or
            (2)
            to prevent significant appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets,
        the President is authorized to proclaim, for a period of 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—
            (A)
            a temporary reduction (of not more than 5 percent ad valorem) in the rate of duty on any article; and
            (B)
            a temporary increase in the value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction, or a temporary suspension of any import restriction.
        Import liberalizing actions proclaimed pursuant to this subsection shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except that the President shall not proclaim measures under this subsection with respect to those articles where in his judgment such action will cause or contribute to material injury to firms or workers in any domestic industry, including agriculture, mining, fishing, or commerce, or to impairment of the national security, or will otherwise be contrary to the national interest.
    Nondiscriminatory treatment of import restricting actions
        (d)
        Nondiscriminatory treatment of import restricting actions
            (1)
            Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be applied consistently with the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment. In addition, any quota proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (a) shall be applied on a basis which aims at a distribution of trade with the United States approaching as closely as possible that which various foreign countries might have expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions.
            (2)
            Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President determines that the purposes of this section will best be served by action against one or more countries having large or persistent balance-of-payments surpluses, he may exempt all other countries from such action.
            (3)
            After such time when there enters into force for the United States new rules regarding the application of surcharges as part of a reform of internationally agreed balance-of-payments adjustment procedures, the exemption authority contained in paragraph (2) shall be applied consistently with such new international rules.
            (4)
            It is the sense of Congress that the President seek modifications in international agreements aimed at allowing the use of surcharges in place of quantitative restrictions (and providing rules to govern the use of such surcharges) as a balance-of-payments adjustment measure within the context of arrangements for an equitable sharing of balance-of-payments adjustment responsibility among deficit and surplus countries.
    Broad and uniform application of import restricting actions
        (e)
        Broad and uniform application of import restricting actions
            Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except where the President determines, consistently with the purposes of this section, that certain articles should not be subject to import restricting actions because of the needs of the United States economy. Such exceptions shall be limited to the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the necessary importation of raw materials, avoiding serious dislocations in the supply of imported goods, and other similar factors. In addition, uniform exceptions may be made where import restricting actions will be unnecessary or ineffective in carrying out the purposes of this section, such as with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions, goods in transit, or goods under binding contract. Neither the authorization of import restricting actions nor the determination of exceptions with respect to product coverage shall be made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic industries from import competition.
    Quantitative limitations
        (f)
        Quantitative limitations
        Any quantitative limitation proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a) on the quantity or value, or both, of an article—
            (1)
            shall permit the importation of a quantity or value which is not less than the quantity or value of such article imported into the United States from the foreign countries to which such limitation applies during the most recent period which the President determines is representative of imports of such article, and
            (2)
            shall take into account any increase since the end of such representative period in domestic consumption of such article and like or similar articles of domestic manufacture or production.
    Suspension, modification, or termination of proclamations
        (g)
        Suspension, modification, or termination of proclamations
            The President may at any time, consistent with the provisions of this section, suspend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any proclamation under this section either during the initial 150-day period of effectiveness or as extended by subsequent Act of Congress.
    Termination of tariff concessions
        (h)
        Termination of tariff concessions
            No provision of law authorizing the termination of tariff concessions shall be used to impose a surcharge on imports into the United States.

        (a)

            (A)

            (B)

                section 2902(a) of this title

                (A)
                the difference between such limitation and the next lower whole number, or
                (B)
                one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
            (4)
            Any concessions granted under subsection (a)(1) shall be reduced and terminated according to substantially the same time schedule for reduction applicable to the relevant action under sections 2253(e) and 2254 of this title.

        (c)
        Consideration of past violations of trade concessions
            Before entering into any trade agreement under this section with any foreign country or instrumentality, the President shall consider whether such country or instrumentality has violated trade concessions of benefit to the United States and such violation has not been adequately offset by the action of the United States or by such country or instrumentality.

        (d)
        Basic authority for trade agreements as authority for granting new concessions as compensation

        (a)
        Trade agreements
        Whenever the President determines that any existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President—

            may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities thereof, and
            (2)

                    any other person or group of persons,
                may, individually, submit to the Commission commitments regarding actions such persons and entities intend to take to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.

    Investigations and determinations by Commission
        (b)
        Investigations and determinations by Commission
            (1)
                (A)
                Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a), the request of the President or the Trade Representative, the resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the Commission shall promptly make an investigation to determine whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article.
                (B)
                For purposes of this section, the term “substantial cause” means a cause which is important and not less than any other cause.
            (2)
                (A)
                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 120 days (180 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date on which the petition is filed, the request or resolution is received, or the motion is adopted, as the case may be.
                (B)
                If before the 100th day after a petition is filed under subsection (a)(1) the Commission determines that the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, the Commission shall make the determination under paragraph (1) within 150 days (210 days if the petition alleges that critical circumstances exist) after the date referred to in subparagraph (A).
            (3)
            The Commission shall publish notice of the commencement of any proceeding under this subsection in the Federal Register and shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, hold public hearings at which the Commission shall afford interested parties and consumers an opportunity to be present, to present evidence, to comment on the adjustment plan, if any, submitted under subsection (a), to respond to the presentations of other parties and consumers, and otherwise to be heard.
    Factors applied in making determinations
        (c)
        Factors applied in making determinations
            (1)
            In making determinations under subsection (b), the Commission shall take into account all economic factors which it considers relevant, including (but not limited to)—
                (A)
                with respect to serious injury—
                    (i)
                    the significant idling of productive facilities in the domestic industry,
                    (ii)
                    the inability of a significant number of firms to carry out domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit, and
                    (iii)
                    significant unemployment or underemployment within the domestic industry;
                (B)
                with respect to threat of serious injury—
                    (i)
                    a decline in sales or market share, a higher and growing inventory (whether maintained by domestic producers, importers, wholesalers, or retailers), and a downward trend in production, profits, wages, productivity, or employment (or increasing underemployment) in the domestic industry,
                    (ii)
                    the extent to which firms in the domestic industry are unable to generate adequate capital to finance the modernization of their domestic plants and equipment, or are unable to maintain existing levels of expenditures for research and development,
                    (iii)
                    the extent to which the United States market is the focal point for the diversion of exports of the article concerned by reason of restraints on exports of such article to, or on imports of such article into, third country markets; and
                (C)
                with respect to substantial cause, an increase in imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) and a decline in the proportion of the domestic market supplied by domestic producers.
            (2)
            In making determinations under subsection (b), the Commission shall—
                (A)
                consider the condition of the domestic industry over the course of the relevant business cycle, but may not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn in the United States economy into a single cause of serious injury or threat of injury; and
                (B)
                examine factors other than imports which may be a cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry.
            The Commission shall include the results of its examination under subparagraph (B) in the report submitted by the Commission to the President under subsection (e).
            (3)
            The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to evaluate in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry.
            (4)
            For purposes of subsection (b), in determining the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with an imported article, the Commission—
                (A)
                to the extent information is available, shall, in the case of a domestic producer which also imports, treat as part of such domestic industry only its domestic production;
                (B)
                may, in the case of a domestic producer which produces more than one article, treat as part of such domestic industry only that portion or subdivision of the producer which produces the like or directly competitive article; and
                (C)
                may, in the case of one or more domestic producers which produce a like or directly competitive article in a major geographic area of the United States and whose production facilities in such area for such article constitute a substantial portion of the domestic industry in the United States and primarily serve the market in such area, and where the imports are concentrated in such area, treat as such domestic industry only that segment of the production located in such area.
            (5)
            In the course of any proceeding under this subsection, the Commission shall investigate any factor which in its judgment may be contributing to increased imports of the article under investigation. Whenever in the course of its investigation the Commission has reason to believe that the increased imports are attributable in part to circumstances which come within the purview of subtitles A and B of title VII [
                19 U.S.C. 1671
                19 U.S.C. 1337
            (6)
            For purposes of this section:
                (A)
                    (i)
                    The term “domestic industry” means, with respect to an article, the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive article or those producers whose collective production of the like or directly competitive article constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of such article.
                    (ii)
                    The term “domestic industry” includes producers located in the United States insular possessions.
                (B)
                The term “significant idling of productive facilities” includes the closing of plants or the underutilization of production capacity.
                (C)
                The term “serious injury” means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry.
                (D)
                The term “threat of serious injury” means serious injury that is clearly imminent.
    Provisional relief
        (d)
        Provisional relief
            (1)
                (A)
                An entity representing a domestic industry that produces a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that is like or directly competitive with an imported perishable agricultural product or citrus product may file a request with the Trade Representative for the monitoring of imports of that product under subparagraph (B). Within 21 days after receiving the request, the Trade Representative shall determine if—
                    (i)
                    the imported product is a perishable agricultural product or citrus product; and
                    (ii)
                    there is a reasonable indication that such product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be, or likely to be, a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to such domestic industry.
                (B)
                If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Trade Representative shall request, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 [
                    19 U.S.C. 1332(g)
                (C)
                If a petition filed under subsection (a)—
                    (i)
                    alleges injury from imports of a perishable agricultural product or citrus product that has been, on the date the allegation is included in the petition, subject to monitoring by the Commission under subparagraph (B) for not less than 90 days; and
                    (ii)
                    requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to such imports;
                the Commission shall, not later than the 21st day after the day on which the request was filed, make a determination, on the basis of available information, whether increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the perishable agricultural product or citrus product are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive perishable product or citrus product, and whether either—
                    (I)
                    the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product; or
                    (II)
                    the serious injury cannot be timely prevented through investigation under subsection (b) and action under
                        section 2253 of this title
                (D)
                At the request of the Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture shall promptly provide to the Commission any relevant information that the Department of Agriculture may have for purposes of making determinations and findings under this subsection.
                (E)
                Whenever the Commission makes an affirmative preliminary determination under subparagraph (C), the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.
                (F)
                The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determination under subparagraph (C) and, if the determination is affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (E).
                (G)
                Within 7 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (F) containing an affirmative determination, the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (E), shall proclaim such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury.
            (2)
                (A)
                When a petition filed under subsection (a) alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests that provisional relief be provided under this subsection with respect to imports of the article identified in the petition, the Commission shall, not later than 60 days after the petition containing the request was filed, determine, on the basis of available information, whether—
                    (i)
                    there is clear evidence that increased imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article; and
                    (ii)
                    delay in taking action under this part would cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair.
                (B)
                If the determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) are affirmative, the Commission shall find the amount or extent of provisional relief that is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Commission shall give preference to increasing or imposing a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.
                (C)
                The Commission shall immediately report to the President its determinations under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii) and, if the determinations are affirmative, the finding under subparagraph (B).
                (D)
                Within 30 days after receiving a report from the Commission under subparagraph (C) containing an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A)(i) and (ii), the President, if he considers provisional relief to be warranted and after taking into account the finding of the Commission under subparagraph (B), shall proclaim, for a period not to exceed 200 days, such provisional relief that the President considers necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury. Such relief shall take the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty on imports, if such form of relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy the serious injury.
            (3)
            If provisional relief is proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D) in the form of an increase, or the imposition of, a duty, the President shall order the suspension of liquidation of all imported articles subject to the affirmative determination under paragraph (1)(C) or paragraph (2)(A), as the case may be, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date of the determination.
            (4)
                (A)
                Any provisional relief implemented under this subsection with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which—
                    (i)
                    if such relief was proclaimed under paragraph (1)(G) or (2)(D), the Commission makes a negative determination under subsection (b) regarding injury or the threat thereof by imports of such article;
                    (ii)
                    action described in section 2253(a)(3)(A) or (C) of this title takes effect under
                        section 2253 of this title
                    (iii)
                    a decision by the President not to take any action under
                        section 2253(a) of this title
                    (iv)
                    whenever the President determines that, because of changed circumstances, such relief is no longer warranted.
                (B)
                Any suspension of liquidation ordered under paragraph (3) with respect to an imported article shall terminate on the day on which provisional relief is terminated under subparagraph (A) with respect to the article.
                (C)
                If an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty that is proclaimed under
                    section 2253 of this title
                (D)
                If provisional relief in the form of an increase in, or the imposition of, a duty is proclaimed under this section with respect to an imported article and neither a duty increase nor a duty imposition is proclaimed under
                    section 2253 of this title
            (5)
            For purposes of this subsection:
                (A)
                The term “citrus product” means any processed oranges or grapefruit, or any orange or grapefruit juice, including concentrate.
                (B)
                A perishable agricultural product is any agricultural article, including livestock, regarding which the Trade Representative considers action under this section to be appropriate after taking into account—
                    (i)
                    whether the article has—
                        (I)
                        a short shelf life,
                        (II)
                        a short growing season, or
                        (III)
                        a short marketing period,
                    (ii)
                    whether the article is treated as a perishable product under any other Federal law or regulation; and
                    (iii)
                    any other factor considered appropriate by the Trade Representative.
                The presence or absence of any factor which the Trade Representative is required to take into account under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) is not necessarily dispositive of whether an article is a perishable agricultural product.
                (C)
                The term “provisional relief” means—
                    (i)
                    any increase in, or imposition of, any duty;
                    (ii)
                    any modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of an article into the United States; or
                    (iii)
                    any combination of actions under clauses (i) and (ii).
    Commission recommendations
        (e)
        Commission recommendations
            (1)
            If the Commission makes an affirmative determination under subsection (b)(1), the Commission shall also recommend the action that would address the serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry and be most effective in facilitating the efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition.
            (2)
            The Commission is authorized to recommend under paragraph (1)—
                (A)

                (B)
                a tariff-rate quota on the article;
                (C)
                a modification or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of the article into the United States;
                (D)
                one or more appropriate adjustment measures, including the provision of trade adjustment assistance under part 2 of this subchapter; or
                (E)
                any combination of the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (D).
            (3)
            The Commission shall specify the type, amount, and duration of the action recommended by it under paragraph (1). The limitations set forth in
                section 2253(e) of this title
            (4)
            In addition to the recommendation made under paragraph (1), the Commission may also recommend that the President—
                (A)
                initiate international negotiations to address the underlying cause of the increase in imports of the article or otherwise to alleviate the injury or threat; or
                (B)
                implement any other action authorized under law that is likely to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.
            (5)
            For purposes of making its recommendation under this subsection, the Commission shall—
                (A)
                after reasonable notice, hold a public hearing at which all interested parties shall be provided an opportunity to present testimony and evidence; and
                (B)
                take into account—
                    (i)
                    the form and amount of action described in paragraph (2)(A), (B), and (C) that would prevent or remedy the injury or threat thereof,
                    (ii)
                    the objectives and actions specified in the adjustment plan, if any, submitted under subsection (a)(4),
                    (iii)
                    any individual commitment that was submitted to the Commission under subsection (a)(6),
                    (iv)
                    any information available to the Commission concerning the conditions of competition in domestic and world markets, and likely developments affecting such conditions during the period for which action is being requested, and
                    (v)
                    whether international negotiations may be constructive to address the injury or threat thereof or to facilitate adjustment.
            (6)
            Only those members of the Commission who agreed to the affirmative determination under subsection (b) are eligible to vote on the recommendation required to be made under paragraph (1) or that may be made under paragraph (3).

                If, during any fiscal year, the Secretary estimates that the amount of funds necessary to pay the costs of training approved under this section will exceed the amount of the limitation imposed under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall decide how the portion of such limitation that has not been expended at the time of such estimate is to be apportioned among the States for the remainder of such fiscal year.

                The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to, or take into account, any funds provided under any other provision of Federal law which are used for any purpose other than the direct payment of the costs incurred in training a particular adversely affected worker, even if such use has the effect of indirectly paying or reducing any portion of the costs involved in training the adversely affected worker.
            (5)
            The training programs that may be approved under paragraph (1) include, but are not limited to—

            (2)
            An employee stock ownership plan does not meet the requirements of this subsection unless the governing instrument of the plan provides that—
                (A)
                the amount of the loan paid under paragraph (1)(A) to the qualified trust will be used to purchase qualified employer securities,
                (B)
                the qualified trust will repay to the lender the amount of such loan, together with the interest thereon, out of amounts contributed to the trust by the recipient corporation, and
                (C)

                (B)

                (C)
                it provides that amounts received by the recipient corporation from the qualified trust for qualified employer securities purchased for the purpose of this subsection will be used exclusively by the recipient corporation for those purposes for which it may use that portion of the loan paid directly to it by the lender,

            Any action taken under paragraph (1) to eliminate an act, policy, or practice shall be devised so as to affect goods or services of the foreign country in an amount that is equivalent in value to the burden or restriction being imposed by that country on United States commerce.
    Discretionary action
        (b)
        Discretionary action
        If the Trade Representative determines under
            section 2414(a)(1) of this title
            (1)
            an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country is unreasonable or discriminatory and burdens or restricts United States commerce, and
            (2)
            action by the United States is appropriate, the Trade Representative shall take all appropriate and feasible action authorized under subsection (c), subject to the specific direction, if any, of the President regarding any such action, and all other appropriate and feasible action within the power of the President that the President may direct the Trade Representative to take under this subsection, to obtain the elimination of that act, policy, or practice.

                        (I)
                        are satisfactory to the Trade Representative, and
                        (II)
                        meet the requirements of paragraph (4).
            (2)
                (A)
                Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing any service sector access authorization, and in addition to the authority conferred in paragraph (1), the Trade Representative may, for purposes of carrying out the provisions of subsection (a) or (b)—

                    a petition is filed under
                        section 2412(a) of this title
                    (ii)
                    a determination to initiate an investigation is made by the Trade Representative under
                        section 2412(b) of this title
                (C)
                Before the Trade Representative takes any action under this section involving the imposition of fees or other restrictions on the services of a foreign country, the Trade Representative shall, if the services involved are subject to regulation by any agency of the Federal Government or of any State, consult, as appropriate, with the head of the agency concerned.

                without regard to whether or not such goods or economic sector were involved in the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of such action.
            (4)
            Any trade agreement described in paragraph (1)(D)(iii) shall provide compensatory trade benefits that benefit the economic sector which includes the domestic industry that would benefit from the elimination of the act, policy, or practice that is the subject of the action to be taken under subsection (a) or (b), or benefit the economic sector as closely related as possible to such economic sector, unless—
                (A)
                the provision of such trade benefits is not feasible, or
                (B)
                trade benefits that benefit any other economic sector would be more satisfactory than such trade benefits.
            (5)
            If the Trade Representative determines that actions to be taken under subsection (a) or (b) are to be in the form of import restrictions, the Trade Representative shall—
                (A)
                give preference to the imposition of duties over the imposition of other import restrictions, and
                (B)
                if an import restriction other than a duty is imposed, consider substituting, on an incremental basis, an equivalent duty for such other import restriction.
            (6)
            Any action taken by the Trade Representative under this section with respect to export targeting shall, to the extent possible, reflect the full benefit level of the export targeting to the beneficiary over the period during which the action taken has an effect.

The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been submitted in connection with each investigation.
            (4)
            The report of the Commission of its determination with respect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of information which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.

        With respect to any affirmative determination of the Commission under subsection (a)—
            (1)
            such determination shall be treated as an affirmative determination made under
                section 2251(b) of this title
            (2)
            sections 2252 and 2253 of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act of 1988), rather than the provisions of part 1 of subchapter II of this chapter as amended by section 1401 of such Act of 1988, shall apply with respect to the taking of subsequent action, if any, by the President in response to such affirmative determination;
        except that—
            (A)
            the President may take action under such sections 2252 and 2253 of this title only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and
            (B)
            if such action consists of, or includes, an orderly marketing agreement, such agreement shall be entered into within 60 days after the import relief determination date.
    Products of Communist countries
        (c)
        Products of Communist countries
            If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a). If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a). Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission’s report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.

        (d)

                    The term “significant cause” refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.
                (C)

        (a)
        Growth, product, or manufacture of beneficiary countries
            (1)
            Unless otherwise excluded from eligibility by this chapter, and subject to section 423 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and except as provided in subsection (b)(2) and (3), the duty-free treatment provided under this chapter shall apply to any article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country if—
                (A)

            For purposes of determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B), the term “beneficiary country” includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any former beneficiary country. If the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States (other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) is included with respect to an article to which this paragraph applies, an amount not to exceed 15 per centum of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered that is attributed to such United States cost or value may be applied toward determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (B).
            (2)
            The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this subsection including, but not limited to, regulations providing that, in order to be eligible for duty-free treatment under this chapter, an article must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country, or must be a new or different article of commerce which has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the beneficiary country; but no article or material of a beneficiary country shall be eligible for such treatment by virtue of having merely undergone—

                simple combining or packaging operations, or
                (B)
                mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.
            (3)
            As used in this subsection, the phrase “direct costs of processing operations” includes, but is not limited to—
                (A)
                all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel; and
                (B)
                dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise.
            Such phrase does not include costs which are not directly attributable to the merchandise concerned or are not costs of manufacturing the product, such as (i) profit, and (ii) general expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen’s salaries, commissions or expenses.

                (A)
                the article is imported directly from the beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States,
                (B)
                the article was by any means advanced in value or improved in condition in a beneficiary country, and
                (C)
                if any materials are added to the article in a beneficiary country, such materials are a product of a beneficiary country or the United States.
            (6)
            Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the duty-free treatment provided under this chapter shall apply to liqueurs and spirituous beverages produced in the territory of Canada from rum if—
                (A)
                such rum is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country or of the Virgin Islands of the United States;
                (B)
                such rum is imported directly from a beneficiary country or the Virgin Islands of the United States into the territory of Canada, and such liqueurs and spirituous beverages are imported directly from the territory of Canada into the customs territory of the United States;
                (C)

                        If the President determines, based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter has engaged in transshipment with respect to textile or apparel articles from a CBTPA beneficiary country, then the President shall deny all benefits under this chapter to such exporter, and any successor of such exporter, for a period of 2 years.
                Penalties for countries

§ 2801. Congressional findings and purposes
        (a)
        Congress finds that—
            (1)
            there is a substantial imbalance in international wine trade resulting, in part, from the relative accessibility enjoyed by foreign wines to the United States market while the United States wine industry faces restrictive tariff and nontariff barriers in virtually every existing or potential foreign market;
            (2)
            the restricted access to foreign markets and the continued low prices for United States wine and grape products adversely affect the economic position of our Nation’s winemakers and grape growers, as well as all other domestic sectors that depend upon wine production;
            (3)
            the competitive position of United States wine in international trade has been weakened by foreign trade practices, high domestic interest rates, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates;
            (4)
            wine consumption per capita is very low in many major non-wine producing markets and the demand potential for United States wine is significant; and
            (5)
            the United States winemaking industry has the capacity and the ability to export substantial volumes of wine and an increase in United States wine exports will create new jobs, improve this Nation’s balance of trade, and otherwise strengthen the national economy.
        (b)
        The purposes of this chapter are—
            (1)
            to provide wine consumers with the greatest possible choice of wines from wine-producing countries;
            (2)
            to encourage the initiation of an export promotion program to develop, maintain, and expand foreign markets for United States wine; and
            (3)
            to achieve greater access to foreign markets for United States wine and grape products through the reduction or elimination of tariff barriers and nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in wine.

            section 2803 of this title
        (4)
        The phrase “nontariff barrier to (or other distortion of)”, in the context of trade in United States wine, includes any measure implemented by the government of a major wine trading country that either gives a competitive advantage to the wine industry of that country or restricts the importation of United States wine into that country.
        (5)

§ 2803. Designation of major wine trading countries
        (a)

            (1)
            is a potential significant market for United States wine; and
            (2)
            maintains tariff barriers or nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in United States wine.
        (b)

                    dispute settlement provisions and enforcement procedures,

                (B)
                In pursuing the negotiating objectives described in subparagraph (A), United States negotiators shall take into account legitimate United States domestic objectives including, but not limited to, the protection of legitimate health or safety, essential security, environmental, consumer or employment opportunity interests and the law and regulations related thereto.

        (a)
        Agreements regarding tariff barriers
            (1)
            Whenever the President determines that one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes, policies, and objectives of this title will be promoted thereby, the President—
                (A)
                before
                    June 1, 1993
                (B)
                may, subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), proclaim—
                    (i)
                    such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
                    (ii)
                    such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or
                    (iii)

                as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.

            No proclamation may be made under subsection (a) that—
                (A)
                reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on
                    August 23, 1988

                Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in effect on such day if a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed in paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement with respect to such article.
                (B)

            (4)

                (A)
                the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
                (B)
                one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
            (5)
            No reduction in a rate of duty under a trade agreement entered into under subsection (a) on any article may take effect more than 10 years after the effective date of the first reduction under paragraph (1) that is proclaimed to carry out the trade agreement with respect to such article.
            (6)
            A rate of duty reduction or increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction or increase is included within an implementing bill provided for under

        (b)
        Agreements regarding nontariff barriers

                (A)
                unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects the United States economy; or
                (B)
                the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect;

                to take such other actions through the modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction as may be necessary or appropriate under the authority of the President.
            (3)
            If a rate of duty established in column 1 by the President by proclamation or Executive order is higher than the existing rate of duty in column 2, the President may by proclamation or Executive order increase such existing rate to the higher rate.
            (4)
            If a rate of duty is suspended or terminated by the President by proclamation or Executive order and the proclamation or Executive order does not specify the rate that is to apply in lieu of the suspended or terminated rate, the last rate of duty that applied prior to the suspended or terminated rate shall be the efffective

§ 3101. Findings and purposes
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds that—
            (1)
            rapid growth in the world market for telecommunications products and services is likely to continue for several decades;
            (2)
            the United States can improve prospects for—
                (A)
                the growth of—
                    (i)
                    United States exports of telecommunications products and services, and
                    (ii)
                    export-related employment and consumer services in the United States, and
                (B)
                the continuance of the technological leadership of the United States,
            by undertaking a program to achieve an open world market for trade in telecommunications products, services, and investment;
            (3)
            most foreign markets for telecommunications products, services, and investment are characterized by extensive government intervention (including restrictive import practices and discriminatory procurement practices) which adversely affect United States exports of telecommunications products and services and United States investment in telecommunications;
            (4)
            the open nature of the United States telecommunications market, accruing from the liberalization and restructuring of such market, has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to an increase in imports of telecommunications products and a growing imbalance in competitive opportunities for trade in telecommunications;
            (5)
            unless this imbalance is corrected through the achievement of mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade in telecommunications products and services between the United States and foreign countries, the United States should avoid granting continued open access to the telecommunications products and services of such foreign countries in the United States market; and
            (6)
            the unique business conditions in the worldwide market for telecommunications products and services caused by the combination of deregulation and divestiture in the United States, which represents a unilateral liberalization of United States trade with the rest of the world, and continuing government intervention in the domestic industries of many other countries create a need to make an exception in the case of telecommunications products and services that should not necessarily be a precedent for legislating specific sectoral priorities in combating the closed markets or unfair foreign trade practices of other countries.
    Purposes
        (b)
        Purposes
        The purposes of this chapter are—
            (1)
            to foster the economic and technological growth of, and employment in, the United States telecommunications industry;
            (2)
            to secure a high quality telecommunications network for the benefit of the people of the United States;
            (3)
            to develop an international consensus in favor of open trade and competition in telecommunications products and services;
            (4)
            to ensure that countries which have made commitments to open telecommunications trade fully abide by those commitments; and
            (5)
            to achieve a more open world trading system for telecommunications products and services through negotiation and provision of mutually advantageous market opportunities for United States telecommunications exporters and their subsidiaries in those markets in which barriers exist to free international trade.

            (2)
            the economic benefits (actual and potential) accruing to foreign firms from open access to the United States market;
            (3)
            the potential size of the market of a foreign country for telecommunications products and services of United States firms;
            (4)
            the potential to increase United States exports of telecommunications products and services, either directly or through the establishment of a beneficial precedent; and
            (5)
            measurable progress being made to eliminate the objectionable acts, policies, or practices.

            Unless otherwise excluded from eligibility (or otherwise provided for) by this chapter, the duty-free treatment (or preferential treatment) provided under this chapter shall apply to any article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country if—
                (A)
                that article is imported directly from a beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States; and

                simple combining or packaging operations, or
                (B)

            (3)
            As used in this subsection, the phrase “direct costs of processing operations” includes, but is not limited to—
                (A)
                all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel; and
                (B)
                dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the specific merchandise.

§ 3701. Findings
        (1)
        it is in the mutual interest of the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa;
        (2)
        the countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region richly endowed with both natural and human resources;
        (3)
        sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous economic potential and of enduring political significance to the United States;
        (4)
        the region has experienced the strengthening of democracy as countries in sub-Saharan Africa have taken steps to encourage broader participation in the political process;
        (5)
        certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa have increased their economic growth rates, taken significant steps towards liberalizing their economies, and made progress toward regional economic integration that can have positive benefits for the region;

        despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa averages approximately $500 annually;

        (9)
        offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of the positive economic and political developments under way throughout the region; and
        (10)
        encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for the region as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.

§ 3731. Sense of the Congress regarding comprehensive debt relief for the world’s poorest countries
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        Congress makes the following findings:
            (1)
            The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world’s poorest countries.
            (2)
            Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.
            (3)
            Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world’s poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.
            (4)
            In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.
            (5)
            The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the world’s poorest countries.
    Sense of the Congress
        (b)
        Sense of the Congress
        It is the sense of the Congress that—
            (1)
            Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world’s poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation;
            (2)
            this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;
            (3)
            this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;
            (4)
            these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account;
            (5)
            no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and
            (6)
            in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.
§ 3732. Executive branch initiatives
    Statement of the Congress
        (a)
        Statement of the Congress
            The Congress recognizes that the stated policy of the executive branch in 1997, the “Partnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa” initiative, is a step toward the establishment of a comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan Africa. It is the sense of the Congress that this Partnership is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this chapter.
    Technical assistance to promote economic reforms and development
        (b)
        Technical assistance to promote economic reforms and development
        In addition to continuing bilateral and multilateral economic and development assistance, the President shall target technical assistance toward—
            (1)
            developing relationships between United States firms and firms in sub-Saharan Africa through a variety of business associations and networks;
            (2)
            providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan African countries to—
                (A)
                liberalize trade and promote exports;
                (B)
                bring their legal regimes into compliance with the standards of the World Trade Organization in conjunction with membership in that Organization;
                (C)
                make financial and fiscal reforms; and
                (D)
                promote greater agribusiness linkages;
            (3)
            addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as market liberalization, agricultural export development, and agribusiness investment in processing and transporting agricultural commodities;
            (4)
            increasing the number of reverse trade missions to growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa;
            (5)
            increasing trade in services; and
            (6)
            encouraging greater sub-Saharan African participation in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and making further commitments in their schedules to the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.
§ 3733. Overseas Private Investment Corporation initiatives
    Initiation of funds
        (a)

            It is the sense of the Congress that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation

        (b)

            Structure
                Each fund initiated under subsection (a) should be structured as a partnership managed by professional private sector fund managers and monitored on a continuing basis by the Corporation.
        Capitalization
            (2)
            Capitalization
                Each fund should be capitalized with a combination of private equity capital, which is not guaranteed by the Corporation, and debt for which the Corporation provides guaranties.
        Infrastructure fund
            (3)
            Infrastructure fund
                One or more of the funds, with combined assets of up to $500,000,000, should be used in support of infrastructure projects in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
        Emphasis
            (4)
            Emphasis

§ 3734. Export-Import Bank initiatives
    Sense of the Congress
        (a)
        Sense of the Congress
            It is the sense of the Congress that the Board of Directors of the Bank shall continue to take comprehensive measures, consistent with the credit standards otherwise required by law, to promote the expansion of the Bank’s financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa under the loan, guarantee and insurance programs of the Bank.
    Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee
        (b)
        Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee
            The sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee (SAAC) is to be commended for aiding the Bank in advancing the economic partnership between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa by doubling the number of sub-Saharan African countries in which the Bank is open for traditional financing and by increasing by tenfold the Bank’s support for sales to sub-Saharan Africa from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999. The Board of Directors of the Bank and its staff shall continue to review carefully the sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee recommendations on the development and implementation of new and innovative policies and programs designed to promote the Bank’s expansion in sub-Saharan Africa.
§ 3735. Expansion of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1)
            The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Commercial Service”) plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.
            (2)
            During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.
            (3)
            Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.
            (4)
            Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.
            (5)
            The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.
            (6)
            Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.
    Appointments
        (b)
        Appointments
        Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than
            December 31, 2001
            (1)
            at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and
            (2)
            full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.
    Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa
        (c)
        Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa
        In order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to—
            (1)
            identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa;
            (2)
            identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;
            (3)
            hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services;
            (4)
            identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and
            (5)
            make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after
                May 18, 2000
§ 3736. Donation of air traffic control equipment to eligible sub-Saharan African countries
        It is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent appropriate, the United States Government should make every effort to donate to governments of sub-Saharan African countries determined to be eligible under
            section 3703 of this title
§ 3737. Additional authorities and increased flexibility to provide assistance under the Development Fund for Africa
    Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth
        (a)
        Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth
            It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment. Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.
    Declarations of policy
        (b)
        Declarations of policy
        The Congress makes the following declarations:
            (1)
            The Development Fund for Africa established under chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (
                22 U.S.C. 2293
            (2)
            The Development Fund for Africa will complement the other provisions of this chapter and lay a foundation for increased trade and investment opportunities between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.
            (3)
            Assistance provided through the Development Fund for Africa will continue to support programs and activities that promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the following:
                (A)
                Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills for operating modern private businesses and the introduction of college level business education, including the study of international business, finance, and stock exchanges.
                (B)
                Strengthening health care systems.
                (C)
                Supporting democratization, good governance and civil society and conflict resolution efforts.
                (D)
                Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and productivity and increasing real incomes for poor individuals.
                (E)
                Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization programs, and market-led economic activities.
                (F)
                Promoting decentralization and local participation in the development process, especially linking the rural production sectors and the industrial and market centers throughout Africa.
                (G)
                Increasing the technical and managerial capacity of sub-Saharan African individuals to manage the economy of sub-Saharan Africa.
                (H)
                Ensuring sustainable economic growth through environmental protection.
            (4)
            The African Development Foundation has a unique congressional mandate to empower the poor to participate fully in development and to increase opportunities for gainful employment, poverty alleviation, and more equitable income distribution in sub-Saharan Africa. The African Development Foundation has worked successfully to enhance the role of women as agents of change, strengthen the informal sector with an emphasis on supporting micro and small sized enterprises, indigenous technologies, and mobilizing local financing. The African Development Foundation should develop and implement strategies for promoting participation in the socioeconomic development process of grassroots and informal sector groups such as nongovernmental organizations, cooperatives, artisans, and traders into the programs and initiatives established under this chapter.
§ 3738. Assistance from United States private sector to prevent and reduce HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa
        It is the sense of the Congress that United States businesses should be encouraged to provide assistance to sub-Saharan African countries to prevent and reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. In providing such assistance, United States businesses should be encouraged to consider the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund in order to provide for coordination among such businesses in the collection and distribution of the assistance to sub-Saharan African countries.
§ 3739. Sense of the Congress relating to HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds the following:
            (1)
            Sustained economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
            (2)
            The HIV/AIDS crisis has reached epidemic proportions in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 21,000,000 men, women, and children are infected with HIV.
            (3)
            Eighty-three percent of the estimated 11,700,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS worldwide have been in sub-Saharan Africa.
            (4)
            The HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is weakening the structure of families and societies.
            (5)
                (A)
                The HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the future of the workforce in sub-Saharan Africa.
                (B)
                Studies show that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa most severely affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 49—the age group that provides the most support for the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.
            (6)
            Clear evidence demonstrates that HIV/AIDS is destructive to the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.
            (7)
            Sustained economic development is critical to creating the public and private sector resources in sub-Saharan Africa necessary to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
    Sense of the Congress
        (b)
        Sense of the Congress
        It is the sense of the Congress that—
            (1)
            addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa should be a central component of United States foreign policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa;
            (2)
            significant progress needs to be made in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in order to sustain a mutually beneficial trade relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries; and
            (3)
            the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is a global threat that merits further attention through greatly expanded public, private, and joint public-private efforts, and through appropriate United States legislation.

        (a)
        In general
        The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with American Land Grant Colleges and Universities and not-for-profit international organizations, is authorized to conduct a 2-year study on ways to improve the flow of American farming techniques and practices to African farmers. The study shall include an examination of ways of improving or utilizing—
            (1)
            knowledge of insect and sanitation procedures;
            (2)
            modern farming and soil conservation techniques;

            modern farming equipment (including maintaining the equipment);
            (4)
            marketing crop yields to prospective purchasers; and
            (5)
            crop maximization practices.
        The Secretary of Agriculture shall submit the study to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives not later than
            September 30, 2001
    Land Grant Colleges and not-for-profit institutions
        (b)
        Land Grant Colleges and not-for-profit institutions
            In conducting the study under subsection (a), the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged to consult with American Land Grant Colleges and not-for-profit international organizations that have firsthand knowledge of current African farming practices.
§ 3741. Sense of the Congress regarding efforts to combat desertification in Africa and other countries
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds that—
            (1)
            desertification affects approximately one-sixth of the world’s population and one-quarter of the total land area;
            (2)
            over 1,000,000 hectares of Africa are affected by desertification;
            (3)
            dryland degradation is an underlying cause of recurrent famine in Africa;
            (4)
            the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that desertification costs the world $42,000,000,000 a year, not including incalculable costs in human suffering; and
            (5)
            the United States can strengthen its partnerships throughout Africa and other countries affected by desertification, help alleviate social and economic crises caused by misuse of natural resources, and reduce dependence on foreign aid, by taking a leading role to combat desertification.
    Sense of the Congress
        (b)
        Sense of the Congress
        It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should expeditiously work with the international community, particularly Africa and other countries affected by desertification, to—
            (1)
            strengthen international cooperation to combat desertification;
            (2)
            promote the development of national and regional strategies to address desertification and increase public awareness of this serious problem and its effects;
            (3)
            develop and implement national action programs that identify the causes of desertification and measures to address it; and
            (4)
            recognize the essential role of local governments and nongovernmental organizations in developing and implementing measures to address desertification.
§ 3801. Short title and findings
    Short title
        (a)
        Short title
            This chapter may be cited as the “Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002”.
    Findings
        (b)
        Findings
        The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1)
            The expansion of international trade is vital to the national security of the United States. Trade is critical to the economic growth and strength of the United States and to its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold War, binding nations together through a series of mutual rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and peace throughout the world.
            (2)
            The national security of the United States depends on its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of the economy of the United States, such as information technology, telecommunications and other leading technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, and intellectual property. Trade will create new opportunities for the United States and preserve the unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, political, and military affairs. The United States, secured by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
            (3)
            Support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under international trade agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in such agreements. Therefore—
                (A)
                the recent pattern of decisions by dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to impose obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures by WTO members under the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards has raised concerns; and
                (B)
                the Congress is concerned that dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body appropriately apply the standard of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO member of provisions of that Agreement, and to the evaluation by a WTO member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.

            (7)
            to seek provisions in trade agreements under which parties to those agreements strive to ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade;
            (8)

                (C)

                (F)

                    (i)

§ 3901. Findings
        (1)
        Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being used by rebels and state actors to finance military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability, and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in large part for control of diamond mining areas. A million of these are refugees eking out a miserable existence in neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have died during these wars.
        (2)
        The countries caught in this fighting are home to nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights violations.
        (3)
        Human rights and humanitarian advocates, the diamond trade as represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United States Government have been working to block the trade in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in conflict diamonds.
        (4)
        The United Nations Security Council has acted at various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to address threats to international peace and security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these actions, it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons to certain countries affected by such conflicts. It has further required all states to prohibit the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are controlled under specified certificate of origin regimes and to prohibit absolutely the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds from Liberia.
        (5)
        In response, the United States implemented sanctions restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation of rough diamonds from Liberia. The United States is now taking further action against trade in conflict diamonds.
        (6)
        Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other countries are involved in working, through the “Kimberley Process”, toward devising a solution to this problem. As the consumer of a majority of the world’s supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.
        (7)
        Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.
        (8)
        Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the trade in conflict diamonds.

            to seek provisions in trade agreements under which parties to those agreements ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade;
            (8)
            to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses equal access to international markets, equitable trade benefits, and expanded export market opportunities, and provide for the reduction or elimination of trade and investment barriers that disproportionately impact small businesses;

    Principal trade negotiating objectives
        (b)
        Principal trade negotiating objectives
        Trade in goods
            (1)
            Trade in goods
            The principal negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade in goods are—
                (A)
                to expand competitive market opportunities for exports of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade, including through the utilization of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign governments directly related to trade that decrease market opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort United States trade; and
                (B)
                to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier elimination agreements, including with respect to those tariff categories covered in
                    section 3521(b) of this title
        Trade in services
            (2)
            Trade in services
                (A)
                The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding trade in services is to expand competitive market opportunities for United States services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade, including through utilization of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict the establishment or operations of service suppliers.
                (B)
                Recognizing that expansion of trade in services generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able to undertake high standard services commitments for both existing and new services.
        Trade in agriculture
            (3)
            Trade in agriculture
            The principal negotiating objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and value added commodities by—
                (A)
                securing more open and equitable market access through robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that—
                    (i)
                    encourage the adoption of international standards and require a science-based justification be provided for a sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the measure is more restrictive than the applicable international standard;
                    (ii)
                    improve regulatory coherence, promote the use of systems-based approaches, and appropriately recognize the equivalence of health and safety protection systems of exporting countries;
                    (iii)
                    require that measures are transparently developed and implemented, are based on risk assessments that take into account relevant international guidelines and scientific data, and are not more restrictive on trade than necessary to meet the intended purpose; and
                    (iv)
                    improve import check processes, including testing methodologies and procedures, and certification requirements,
                while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to protect human, animal, or plant life or health in a manner consistent with their international obligations, including the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in
                    section 3511(d)(3) of this title
                (B)
                reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or other charges that decrease market opportunities for United States exports—
                    (i)
                    giving priority to those products that are subject to significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major producing countries; and
                    (ii)

        Trade facilitation and capacity building
        Findings
            (1)
            Findings
            Congress makes the following findings:
                (A)
                As a land-locked least-developed country, Nepal has severe challenges reaching markets and developing capacity to export goods. As of 2015, exports from Nepal are approximately $800,000,000 per year, with India the major market at $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports about $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of the total goods exported from Nepal.
                (B)
                The World Bank has found evidence that the overall export competitiveness of Nepal has been declining since 2005. Indices compiled by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found that export costs in Nepal are high with respect to both air cargo and container shipments relative to other low-income countries. Such indices also identify particular weaknesses in Nepal with respect to automation of customs and other trade functions, involvement of local exporters and importers in preparing regulations and trade rules, and export finance.
                (C)
                Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly address some of the weaknesses described in subparagraph (B).
        Establishment of trade facilitation and capacity building program
            (2)
            Establishment of trade facilitation and capacity building program
            Not later than 180 days after
                February 24, 2016
                (A)
                to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal to support successful exporters and to build awareness among potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the United States and other countries;
                (B)
                to provide export finance training for financial institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;
                (C)
                to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining publication on the Internet of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation relating to exporting goods and developing a robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization; and
                (D)
                to increase access to guides for importers and exporters, through publication of such guides on the Internet, including rules and documentation for United States tariff preference programs.

            Substantial import share
                In determining whether imports from a USMCA country, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports, such imports normally shall not be considered to account for a substantial share of total imports if that country is not among the top 5 suppliers of the article subject to the investigation, measured in terms of import share during the most recent 3-year period.
