§ 52. Statutory restriction of injunctive relief
        No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney.
        And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; or from paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.

        No court of the United States, as defined in this chapter, shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except in a strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter; nor shall any such restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction be issued contrary to the public policy declared in this chapter.
§ 102. Public policy in labor matters declared
        In the interpretation of this chapter and in determining the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the United States, as such jurisdiction and authority are defined and limited in this chapter, the public policy of the United States is declared as follows:
        Whereas under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; therefore, the following definitions of, and limitations upon, the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the United States are enacted.

§ 141. Short title; Congressional declaration of purpose and policy
    (a) 
        (a)
        This chapter may be cited as the “Labor Management Relations Act, 1947”.
    (b) 
        (b)
        Industrial strife which interferes with the normal flow of commerce and with the full production of articles and commodities for commerce, can be avoided or substantially minimized if employers, employees, and labor organizations each recognize under law one another’s legitimate rights in their relations with each other, and above all recognize under law that neither party has any right in its relations with any other to engage in acts or practices which jeopardize the public health, safety, or interest.
            It is the purpose and policy of this chapter, in order to promote the full flow of commerce, to prescribe the legitimate rights of both employees and employers in their relations affecting commerce, to provide orderly and peaceful procedures for preventing the interference by either with the legitimate rights of the other, to protect the rights of individual employees in their relations with labor organizations whose activities affect commerce, to define and proscribe practices on the part of labor and management which affect commerce and are inimical to the general welfare, and to protect the rights of the public in connection with labor disputes affecting commerce.
§ 142. Definitions
    (1) 
        (1)
        The term “industry affecting commerce” means any industry or activity in commerce or in which a labor dispute would burden or obstruct commerce or tend to burden or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce.
    (2) 
        (2)
        The term “strike” includes any strike or other concerted stoppage of work by employees (including a stoppage by reason of the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement) and any concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by employees.
    (3) 
        (3)
        The terms “commerce”, “labor disputes”, “employer”, “employee”, “labor organization”, “representative”, “person”, and “supervisor” shall have the same meaning as when used in subchapter II of this chapter.
§ 143. Saving provisions
        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require an individual employee to render labor or service without his consent, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to make the quitting of his labor by an individual employee an illegal act; nor shall any court issue any process to compel the performance by an individual employee of such labor or service, without his consent; nor shall the quitting of labor by an employee or employees in good faith because of abnormally dangerous conditions for work at the place of employment of such employee or employees be deemed a strike under this chapter.
§ 144. Separability
        If any provision of this chapter, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, shall be held invalid, the remainder of this chapter, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.
§ 151. Findings and declaration of policy
        The denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce.
        The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.
        Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.
        Experience has further demonstrated that certain practices by some labor organizations, their officers, and members have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by preventing the free flow of goods in such commerce through strikes and other forms of industrial unrest or through concerted activities which impair the interest of the public in the free flow of such commerce. The elimination of such practices is a necessary condition to the assurance of the rights herein guaranteed.
        It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

        The Congress finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce. That Congress further finds that the employment of persons in domestic service in households affects commerce.
    (b) 
        (b)
        It is declared to be the policy of this chapter, through the exercise by Congress of its power to regulate commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, to correct and as rapidly as practicable to eliminate the conditions above referred to in such industries without substantially curtailing employment or earning power.

                (B)

            29 U.S.C. 201
            The Congress further finds that all of the foregoing constitutes a substantial burden on commerce and a substantial obstruction to the free flow of goods in commerce.
            The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that it is in the national public interest and for the general welfare, essential to national defense, and necessary to aid, protect, and foster commerce, that this chapter be enacted.
            The Congress further finds that the varying and extended periods of time for which, under the laws of the several States, potential retroactive liability may be imposed upon employers, have given and will give rise to great difficulties in the sound and orderly conduct of business and industry.
            1 
            The Congress further finds and declares that all of the results which have arisen or may arise under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, as aforesaid, may (except as to liability for liquidated damages) arise with respect to the Walsh-Healey and Bacon-Davis Acts

    (a) Standards for labor-management relations
        (a)
        Standards for labor-management relations
            The Congress finds that, in the public interest, it continues to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect employees’ rights to organize, choose their own representatives, bargain collectively, and otherwise engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection; that the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation; and that in order to accomplish the objective of a free flow of commerce it is essential that labor organizations, employers, and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations, particularly as they affect labor-management relations.
    (b) Protection of rights of employees and the public
        (b)
        Protection of rights of employees and the public
            The Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.
    (c) Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practices
        (c)
        Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practices
            The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that the enactment of this chapter is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended [

§ 621. Congressional statement of findings and purpose
    (a) 
        (a)
        The Congress hereby finds and declares that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            in the face of rising productivity and affluence, older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs;
        (2) 
            (2)
            the setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance has become a common practice, and certain otherwise desirable practices may work to the disadvantage of older persons;
        (3) 
            (3)
            the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant deterioration of skill, morale, and employer acceptability is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing; and their employment problems grave;
        (4) 
            (4)
            the existence in industries affecting commerce, of arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age, burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce.
    (b) 
        (b)
        It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.

        (a)

        (1)

            undertake research, and promote research, with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons, and the promotion of measures for utilizing their skills;
        (2) 
            (2)
            publish and otherwise make available to employers, professional societies, the various media of communication, and other interested persons the findings of studies and other materials for the promotion of employment;
        (3) 
            (3)
            foster through the public employment service system and through cooperative effort the development of facilities of public and private agencies for expanding the opportunities and potentials of older persons;
        (4) 
            (4)
            sponsor and assist State and community informational and educational programs.

                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) if a participant’s accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.
                (ii) 
                    (ii)

                        An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.

                        Termination requirements
                    An applicable defined benefit plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) unless the plan provides that, upon the termination of the plan—

Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, or by the Secretary on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.

§ 718. Traditionally underserved populations
    (a) Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:
        (1) Racial profile
            (1)
            Racial profile
                The demographic profile of America is rapidly changing. While the percentage increase from 2000 to 2010 for white Americans was 9.7 percent, the percentage increase for racial and ethnic minorities was much higher: 43.0 percent for Latinos, 12.3 percent for African-Americans, and 43.2 percent for Asian-Americans.
        (2) Rate of disability
            (2)
            Rate of disability
            Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. In 2011—
            (A) 
                (A)
                among Americans ages 16 through 64, the rate of disability was 12.1 percent;
            (B) 
                (B)
                among African-Americans in that age range, the disability rate was more than twice as high, at 27.1 percent; and
            (C) 
                (C)
                for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the same age range, the disability rate was also more than twice as high, at 27.0 percent.
        (3) Inequitable treatment
            (3)
            Inequitable treatment
                Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.
        (4) Recruitment
            (4)
            Recruitment
                Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.
    (b) Outreach to minorities
        (b)
        Outreach to minorities
        (1) In general

                    is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)

            (D) 
                (D)
                reasons for significant numbers of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    discrimination;
                (ii) 
                    (ii)

                (G)

                (A)
                an integral part of a statewide workforce development system; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, informed choice, and economic self-sufficiency, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.

                (A)
                Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.
            (B) 
                (B)
                Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain competitive integrated employment.

                (D)

                (F)
                Individuals with disabilities and the individuals’ representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.

            The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.
    (b) Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries
        (b)
        Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries
            It is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.
    (c) Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance
        (c)
        Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance
            It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.
§ 1001a. Additional Congressional findings and declaration of policy
    (a) Effects of multiemployer pension plans
        (a)
        Effects of multiemployer pension plans
        The Congress finds that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;
        (2) 
            (2)
            multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;
        (3) 
            (3)
            the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and
        (4) 
            (4)
            (A) 
                (A)
                withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and
            (B) 
                (B)
                in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.
    (b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program
        (b)
        Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program
        The Congress further finds that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and
        (2) 
            (2)
            it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.
    (c) Policy
        (c)
        Policy
        It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act—
        (1) 
            (1)
            to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,
        (2) 
            (2)
            to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,
        (3) 
            (3)
            to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and
        (4) 
            (4)
            to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.
§ 1001b. Findings and declaration of policy
    (a) Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            single-employer defined benefit pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national interest;
        (2) 
            (2)
            the continued well-being and retirement income security of millions of workers, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by such plans;
        (3) 
            (3)
            the existence of a sound termination insurance system is fundamental to the retirement income security of participants and beneficiaries of such plans; and
        (4) 
            (4)
            the current termination insurance system in some instances encourages employers to terminate pension plans, evade their obligations to pay benefits, and shift unfunded pension liabilities onto the termination insurance system and the other premium-payers.
    (b) Additional findings
        (b)
        Additional findings
        The Congress further finds that modification of the current termination insurance system and an increase in the insurance premium for single-employer defined benefit pension plans—
        (1) 
            (1)
            is desirable to increase the likelihood that full benefits will be paid to participants and beneficiaries of such plans;
        (2) 
            (2)
            is desirable to provide for the transfer of liabilities to the termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;
        (3) 
            (3)
            is necessary to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and
        (4) 
            (4)
            is necessary to finance properly current funding deficiencies and future obligations of the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system.
    (c) Declaration of policy
        (c)
        Declaration of policy
        It is hereby declared to be the policy of this title—

            to foster and facilitate interstate commerce;
        (2) 
            (2)
            to encourage the maintenance and growth of single-employer defined benefit pension plans;
        (3) 
            (3)
            to increase the likelihood that participants and beneficiaries under single-employer defined benefit pension plans will receive their full benefits;
        (4) 
            (4)
            to provide for the transfer of unfunded pension liabilities onto the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;
        (5) 
            (5)
            to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and
        (6) 
            (6)
            to assure the prudent financing of current funding deficiencies and future obligations of the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system by increasing termination insurance premiums.

                        (II)
                        Lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued
                            For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “lifetime income stream equivalent of the total benefits accrued” means the amount of monthly payments the participant or beneficiary would receive if the total accrued benefits of such participant or beneficiary were used to provide lifetime income streams described in subclause (III), based on assumptions specified in rules prescribed by the Secretary.

                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        explains that the lifetime income stream equivalent is only provided as an illustration;
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        explains that the actual payments under the lifetime income stream described in clause (i)(III) which may be purchased with the total benefits accrued will depend on numerous factors and may vary substantially from the lifetime income stream equivalent in the disclosures;
                    (III) 
                        (III)
                        explains the assumptions upon which the lifetime income stream equivalent was determined; and
                    (IV) 
                        (IV)
                        provides such other similar explanations as the Secretary considers appropriate.
                (iii) Assumptions and rules
                    (iii)

                        (I)

                        (II)
                        issue interim final rules under clause (i).
                In prescribing assumptions under subclause (I), the Secretary may prescribe a single set of specific assumptions (in which case the Secretary may issue tables or factors which facilitate such conversions), or ranges of permissible assumptions. To the extent that an accrued benefit is or may be invested in a lifetime income stream described in clause (i)(III), the assumptions prescribed under subclause (I) shall, to the extent appropriate, permit administrators of individual account plans to use the amounts payable under such lifetime income stream as a lifetime income stream equivalent.
                (iv) Limitation on liability
                    (iv)
                    Limitation on liability
                        No plan fiduciary, plan sponsor, or other person shall have any liability under this subchapter solely by reason of the provision of lifetime income stream equivalents which are derived in accordance with the assumptions and rules described in clause (iii) and which include the explanations contained in the model lifetime income disclosure described in clause (ii). This clause shall apply without regard to whether the provision of such lifetime income stream equivalent is required by subparagraph (B)(iii).
                (v) Effective date
                    (v)
                    Effective date

                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        interim final rules under clause (i);

                        (II)
                        the model disclosure under clause (ii); or
                    (III) 
                        (III)

        The Secretary on his own motion or after having received the petition of an administrator may prescribe an alternative method for satisfying any requirement of this part with respect to any pension plan, or class of pension plans (including pension-linked emergency savings account features within a pension plan), subject to such requirement if he determines—
        (1) 
            (1)
            that the use of such alternative method is consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and that it provides adequate disclosure to the participants and beneficiaries in the plan, and adequate reporting to the Secretary,
        (2) 
            (2)

            (2)
            For purposes of paragraph (1), the present value shall be calculated in accordance with

        Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3), and—
        (1) 
            (1)
            in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1); and

            (2)
            in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2).
    (b) Enumeration of plan requirements
        (b)
        Enumeration of plan requirements
        (1) 
            (1)
            (A) 
                (A)
                A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the number of years (not in excess of 33⅓) of his participation in the plan.
                In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
            (B) 
                (B)
                A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 133⅓ percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and
                (iv) 
                    (iv)
                    social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.
            (C) 
                (C)
                A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
            (D) 
                (D)
                Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to
                        September 2, 1974
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.
            (E) 
                (E)
                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “year of service” has the meaning provided by
                    section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title
            (F) 
                (F)
                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of
                        section 1081(b) of this title
                but only if an employee’s accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of
                    section 1081(b) of this title
            (G) 
                (G)
                Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant’s accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [
                    42 U.S.C. 401
                (i)

                (i) 
                    (i)
                    Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee’s benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee’s benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with
                            section 1056(a)(3) of this title

                    The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.
                (iv) 
                    (iv)
                    Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of

                    (v)
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.
                (vi) 
                    (vi)
                    Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of

            (A) 
                (A)
                A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee’s account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee’s account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.
            (B) 
                (B)
                A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.

            A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if—
            (A) 
                (A)
                in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee’s accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee’s accrued benefit.

            (A) 
                (A)
                For purposes of determining an employee’s accrued benefit, the term “year of participation” means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under

                For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee’s service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.
            (C) 
                (C)
                For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.
            (D) 
                (D)
                In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term “year of participation” shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

                        In general
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) if a participant’s accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                        Similarly situated
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.

                    (iv)
                        Accrued benefit
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the accrued benefit may, under the terms of the plan, be expressed as an annuity payable at normal retirement age, the balance of a hypothetical account, or the current value of the accumulated percentage of the employee’s final average compensation.

                        An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.

                        (I)
                        the participant’s accrued benefit for years of service before the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect before the amendment, plus

                        (II)
                        the participant’s accrued benefit for years of service after the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment.

                        If the benefits of 2 or more defined benefit plans established or maintained by an employer are coordinated in such a manner as to have the effect of the adoption of an amendment described in subclause (I), the sponsor of the defined benefit plan or plans providing for such coordination shall be treated as having adopted such a plan amendment as of the date such coordination begins.

                        Termination requirements
                    An applicable defined benefit plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) unless the plan provides that, upon the termination of the plan—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        if the interest credit rate (or an equivalent amount) under the plan is a variable rate, the rate of interest used to determine accrued benefits under the plan shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest used under the plan during the 5-year period ending on the termination date, and
                    (II) 
                        (II)

                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides for indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.

            (1)
            a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under

        Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (e) Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service
        (e)
        Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service
        For purposes of determining the employee’s accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) and provides that upon such repayment the employee’s accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who—
        (1) 
            (1)
            received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,
        (2) 
            (2)
            resumes employment covered under the plan, and
        (3) 
            (3)
            repays the full amount of such distribution with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C).
        The plan provision required under this subsection may provide that such repayment must be made (A) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (B) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.
    (f) Employer treated as maintaining a plan
        (f)
        Employer treated as maintaining a plan

        (2) 
            (2)
            For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan amendment which has the effect of—
            (A) 
                (A)
                eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or
            (B) 
                (B)
                eliminating an optional form of benefit,
            with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide that this paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in subparagraph (B) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in subparagraph (A)).

                    section 4975(e)(7) of title 26

                (A)
                A defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the “transferee plan”) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because the transferee plan does not provide some or all of the forms of distribution previously available under another defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the “transferor plan”) to the extent that—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    the forms of distribution previously available under the transferor plan applied to the account of a participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan that was transferred from the transferor plan to the transferee plan pursuant to a direct transfer rather than pursuant to a distribution from the transferor plan;
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the terms of both the transferor plan and the transferee plan authorize the transfer described in clause (i);

                    (iv)
                    the election described in clause (iii) was made after the participant or beneficiary received a notice describing the consequences of making the election; and

                    (v)
                    the transferee plan allows the participant or beneficiary described in clause (iii) to receive any distribution to which the participant or beneficiary is entitled under the transferee plan in the form of a single sum distribution.
            (B) 
                (B)
                Subparagraph (A) shall apply to plan mergers and other transactions having the effect of a direct transfer, including consolidations of benefits attributable to different employers within a multiple employer plan.
        (5) 
            (5)
            Except to the extent provided in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, a defined contribution plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because of the elimination of a form of distribution previously available thereunder. This paragraph shall not apply to the elimination of a form of distribution with respect to any participant unless—
            (A) 
                (A)

            (1)
            An applicable pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual (and to each employee organization representing applicable individuals) and to each employer who has an obligation to contribute to the plan.
        (2) 
            (2)
            The notice required by paragraph (1) shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and shall provide sufficient information (as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) to allow applicable individuals to understand the effect of the plan amendment. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide a simplified form of notice for, or exempt from any notice requirement, a plan—
            (A) 
                (A)

                which offers participants the option to choose between the new benefit formula and the old benefit formula.
        (3) 
            (3)
            Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the notice required by paragraph (1) shall be provided within a reasonable time before the effective date of the plan amendment.
        (4) 
            (4)

        (5) 
            (5)
            A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) merely because notice is provided before the adoption of the plan amendment if no material modification of the amendment occurs before the amendment is adopted.
        (6) 
            (6)
            (A)

                In the case of any egregious failure to meet any requirement of this subsection with respect to any plan amendment, the provisions of the applicable pension plan shall be applied as if such plan amendment entitled all applicable individuals to the greater of—

                    (i)
                    the benefits to which they would have been entitled without regard to such amendment, or
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the benefits under the plan with regard to such amendment.
            (B) 
                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), there is an egregious failure to meet the requirements of this subsection if such failure is within the control of the plan sponsor and is—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    an intentional failure (including any failure to promptly provide the required notice or information after the plan administrator discovers an unintentional failure to meet the requirements of this subsection),
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    a failure to provide most of the individuals with most of the information they are entitled to receive under this subsection, or
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    a failure which is determined to be egregious under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
        (7)

            (9)

            (A) 
                (A)

                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.

                (A)
                relying on a consent or revocation referred to in paragraph (1)(A), or
            (B) 
                (B)
                making a determination under paragraph (2),
            then such consent, revocation, or determination shall be treated as valid for purposes of discharging the plan from liability to the extent of payments made pursuant to such Act.
        (7) 
            (7)
            For purposes of this subsection, the term “applicable election period” means—
            (A) 
                (A)
                in the case of an election to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit, the 180-day period ending on the annuity starting date, or
            (B)

            In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.

                    (i)
                    A plan may provide the written explanation described in paragraph (3)(A) after the annuity starting date. In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the applicable election period under paragraph (7) shall not end before the 30th day after the date on which such explanation is provided.
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations limit the application of clause (i), except that such regulations may not limit the period of time by which the annuity starting date precedes the provision of the written explanation other than by providing that the annuity starting date may not be earlier than termination of employment.
            (B) 
                (B)
                A plan may permit a participant to elect (with any applicable spousal consent) to waive any requirement that the written explanation be provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date (or to waive the 30-day requirement under subparagraph (A)) if the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation is provided.

                    In any case in which a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) has been applied to a plan with respect to the plan year preceding the current plan year, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year shall be presumed to be equal to the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the preceding plan year until the enrolled actuary of the plan certifies the actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year.
            (B) Presumption of underfunding after 10th month
                (B)
                Presumption of underfunding after 10th month

                (i) 
                    (i)
                    a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) did not apply to a plan with respect to the plan year preceding the current plan year, but the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for such preceding plan year was not more than 10 percentage points greater than the percentage which would have caused such paragraph to apply to the plan with respect to such preceding plan year, and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    as of the first day of the 4th month of the current plan year, the enrolled actuary of the plan has not certified the actual adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year,
                until the enrolled actuary so certifies, such first day shall be deemed, for purposes of such paragraph, to be the valuation date of the plan for the current plan year and the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan as of such first day shall, for purposes of such paragraph, be presumed to be equal to 10 percentage points less than the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for such preceding plan year.
        (8) Treatment of plan as of close of prohibited or cessation period
            (8)

                Operation of plan after period
                    Unless the plan provides otherwise, payments and accruals will resume effective as of the day following the close of the period for which any limitation of payment or accrual of benefits under paragraph (3) or (4) applies.
            (B) Treatment of affected benefits
                (B)
                Treatment of affected benefits
                    Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as affecting the plan’s treatment of benefits which would have been paid or accrued but for this subsection.

        Special rules applicable to benefit overpayments
        (1) General rule
            (1)
            General rule
            In the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment by any pension plan, the responsible plan fiduciary shall not be considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of this subchapter merely because such fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such overpayment from—
            (A) 
                (A)
                any participant or beneficiary,
            (B) 
                (B)
                any plan sponsor of, or contributing employer to—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    an individual account plan, provided that the amount needed to prevent or restore any impermissible forfeiture from any participant’s or beneficiary’s account arising in connection with the overpayment is, separately from and independently of the overpayment, allocated to such account pursuant to the nonforfeitability requirements of
                        section 1053 of this title
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    a defined benefit pension plan subject to the funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle B, unless the responsible plan fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover all or part of the overpayment faster than required under such funding rules would materially affect the plan’s ability to pay benefits due to other participants and beneficiaries, or
            (C) 
                (C)
                any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary (including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has established prudent procedures to prevent and minimize overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries have followed such procedures, an inadvertent benefit overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.
        (2) Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible party
            (2)
            Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible party
            Paragraph (1) shall not fail to apply with respect to any inadvertent benefit overpayment merely because, after discovering such overpayment, the responsible plan fiduciary—
            (A) 
                (A)
                reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or
            (B) 
                (B)
                seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for the overpayment.
        (3) Employer funding obligations
            (3)
            Employer funding obligations
                Nothing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under part 3 of this subtitle B or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with
                    section 1053 of this title
        (4) Recoupment from participants and beneficiaries
            (4)
            Recoupment from participants and beneficiaries
            If the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following conditions:
            (A) 
                (A)
                No interest or other additional amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for any period.
            (B) 
                (B)
                If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity by reducing future benefit payments—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    the reduction ceases after the plan has recovered the full dollar amount of the overpayment,
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the amount recouped each calendar year does not exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the overpayment, and
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90 percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the terms of the plan.
                Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity through one or more installment payments, the sum of such installment payments in any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions that would be permitted in such year under the preceding sentence.
            (C) 
                (C)
                If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a benefit other than a non-decreasing annuity, the plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary of Labor for purposes of this subparagraph.
            (D) 
                (D)
                Efforts to recoup overpayments are—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless the responsible plan fiduciary makes a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood of success to recover an amount greater than the cost of recovery, and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    not made through a collection agency or similar third party, unless the participant or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement between the participant or beneficiary and the plan, in either case authorizing such recoupment.
            (E) 
                (E)
                Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant is not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, including a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other beneficiary.
            (F) 
                (F)
                Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpayment occurred more than 3 years before the participant or beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the participant.
            (G) 
                (G)
                A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment pursuant to the claims procedures of the plan that made the overpayment to the extent such procedures are consistent with
                    section 1133 of this title
                    section 402(c)(8)(B) of title 26
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of such dispute,
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the plan receiving the rollover shall retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or beneficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpayment as plan assets) pending the outcome of such procedures, and
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted to be returned to such plan if it is determined to be an overpayment (and the plans making and receiving such transfer shall be treated as permitting such transfer).
            (H) 
                (H)
                In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship that recoupment likely would impose on the participant or beneficiary.
        (5) Effect of culpability
            (5)
            Effect of culpability
                Subparagraphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount.

            (A) 
                (A)

                the present value (determined using the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2)) of the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments which have been determined for such plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases and waiver amortization bases of the plan for any plan year preceding such plan year.
        (4) Funding shortfall
            (4)
            Funding shortfall
            For purposes of this section, the funding shortfall of a plan for any plan year is the excess (if any) of—
            (A) 
                (A)

                the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) for the plan year which are held by the plan on the valuation date.
        (5) Exemption from new shortfall amortization base
            (5)
            Exemption from new shortfall amortization base
                In any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(A)) is equal to or greater than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the shortfall amortization base of the plan for such plan year shall be zero.
        (6) Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
            (6)
            Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
                In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the shortfall amortization charge for such plan year and succeeding plan years, the shortfall amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all shortfall amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.

                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    subsequent shortfall amortization installments with respect to such base shall, in reverse order of the otherwise required installments, be reduced to the extent necessary to limit the present value of such subsequent shortfall amortization installments (after application of this paragraph) to the present value of the remaining unamortized shortfall amortization base.

                    If, on each day during the preceding plan year, a plan had 100 or fewer participants, the plan may designate any day during the plan year as its valuation date for such plan year and succeeding plan years. For purposes of this subparagraph, all defined benefit plans which are single-employer plans and are maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer’s controlled group) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only participants with respect to such employer or member shall be taken into account.
            (C) Application of certain rules in determination of plan size
                (C)

            For purposes of this section—
            (A) In general
                (A)
                In general
                    Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of plan assets shall be the fair market value of the assets.
            (B) Averaging allowed
                (B)
                Averaging allowed
                A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.
                Any such averaging shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings (as determined by the plan’s actuary on the basis of an assumed earnings rate specified by the actuary but not in excess of the third segment rate applicable under subsection (h)(2)(C)(iii)), as specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.
        (4) Accounting for contribution receipts
            (4)
            Accounting for contribution receipts

                (i) 
                    (i)
                    an employer makes any contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the plan year in which the contribution is made, and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the contribution is for a preceding plan year,
                the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such contribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.
            (B) Special rule for current year contributions made before valuation date
                (B)
                Special rule for current year contributions made before valuation date
                If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not include—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    such contributions, and

        Actuarial assumptions and methods
        (1) In general
            (1)
            In general
            Subject to this subsection, the determination of any present value or other computation under this section shall be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—
            (A) 
                (A)
                each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and
            (B) 
                (B)
                which, in combination, offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.

            (B) Interest rates for determining funding target
                (B)
                Interest rates for determining funding target

                    (i)
                    in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 5-year period beginning on the valuation date for the plan year, the first segment rate with respect to the applicable month,
                (ii) 
                    (ii)

                        The term “first segment rate” means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 5-year period commencing with such month.
                (ii) Second segment rate
                    (ii)
                    Second segment rate
                        The term “second segment rate” means, with respect to any month, the single rate of interest which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury for such month on the basis of the corporate bond yield curve for such month, taking into account only that portion of such yield curve which is based on bonds maturing during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i).
                (iii) Third segment rate

                        (I)
                        In general
                            If a segment rate described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) with respect to any applicable month (determined without regard to this clause) is less than the applicable minimum percentage, or more than the applicable maximum percentage, of the average of the segment rates described in such clause for years in the 25-year period ending with September 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the plan year begins, then the segment rate described in such clause with respect to the applicable month shall be equal to the applicable minimum percentage or the applicable maximum percentage of such average, whichever is closest. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine such average on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for years in any such 25-year period for which the rates described in any such clause are not available. Notwithstanding anything in this subclause, if the average of the first, second, or third segment rate for any 25-year period is less than 5 percent, such average shall be deemed to be 5 percent.

                    Election to use yield curve
                        Solely for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution under this section, the plan sponsor may, in lieu of the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C), elect to use interest rates under the corporate bond yield curve. For purposes of the preceding sentence such curve shall be determined without regard to the 24-month averaging described in clause (i).

                        Upon request by the plan sponsor and approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, a mortality table which meets the requirements of clause (iii) shall be used in determining any present value or making any computation under this section during the period of consecutive plan years (not to exceed 10) specified in the request.
                (ii) Early termination of period
                    (ii)
                    Early termination of period
                    Notwithstanding clause (i), a mortality table described in clause (i) shall cease to be in effect as of the earliest of—

                        (II)
                        the date on which the plan actuary determines that such table does not meet the requirements of clause (iii).
                (iii) Requirements
                    (iii)
                    Requirements
                    A mortality table meets the requirements of this clause if—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        there is a sufficient number of plan participants, and the pension plans have been maintained for a sufficient period of time, to have credible information necessary for purposes of subclause (II), and
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        such table reflects the actual experience of the pension plans maintained by the sponsor and projected trends in general mortality experience.

                    (iv)
                    All plans in controlled group must use separate table
                    Except as provided by the Secretary of the Treasury, a plan sponsor may not use a mortality table under this subparagraph for any plan maintained by the plan sponsor unless—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        a separate mortality table is established and used under this subparagraph for each other plan maintained by the plan sponsor and if the plan sponsor is a member of a controlled group, each member of the controlled group, and
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        the requirements of clause (iii) are met separately with respect to the table so established for each such plan, determined by only taking into account the participants of such plan, the time such plan has been in existence, and the actual experience of such plan.
                (v) Deadline for submission and disposition of application
                    (v)

                        Disposition
                            Any mortality table submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval under this subparagraph shall be treated as in effect as of the 1st day of the period described in clause (i) unless the Secretary of the Treasury, during the 180-day period beginning on the date of such submission, disapproves of such table and provides the reasons that such table fails to meet the requirements of clause (iii). The 180-day period shall be extended upon mutual agreement of the Secretary of the Treasury and the plan sponsor.

            (4)
            Probability of benefit payments in the form of lump sums or other optional forms
            For purposes of determining any present value or making any computation under this section, there shall be taken into account—
            (A) 
                (A)
                the probability that future benefit payments under the plan will be made in the form of optional forms of benefits provided under the plan (including lump sum distributions, determined on the basis of the plan’s experience and other related assumptions), and
            (B) 
                (B)
                any difference in the present value of such future benefit payments resulting from the use of actuarial assumptions, in determining benefit payments in any such optional form of benefits, which are different from those specified in this subsection.

                (B)
                Plans to which paragraph applies
                This paragraph shall apply to a plan only if—

                    (i)
                    All employees who are not otherwise assumed to retire as of the valuation date but who will be eligible to elect benefits during the plan year and the 10 succeeding plan years shall be assumed to retire at the earliest retirement date under the plan but not before the end of the plan year for which the at-risk funding target and at-risk target normal cost are being determined.
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    All employees shall be assumed to elect the retirement benefit available under the plan at the assumed retirement age (determined after application of clause (i)) which would result in the highest present value of benefits.

        (3) Minimum amount
            (3)
            Minimum amount

                        (II)
                        if an extension was granted under subsection (d) for any plan year before the election to have this subparagraph apply to the plan year, such extension shall not result in such amortization period exceeding 30 years.
                (iii) Net investment losses
                    (iii)
                    Net investment losses

                                section 165 of title 26
            (B) Expanded smoothing period

                    (i)
                    In general
                    A multiemployer plan with respect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may change its asset valuation method in a manner which—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        spreads the difference between expected and actual returns for either or both of the first 2 plan years ending after
                            August 31, 2008
                    (II) 
                        (II)

                            August 31, 2008
                    (III)

                        makes both changes described in subclauses (I) and (II) to such method.
                (ii) Asset valuation methods

                    If this subparagraph applies for any plan year—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        the Secretary of the Treasury shall not treat the asset valuation method of the plan as unreasonable solely because of the changes in such method described in clause (i), and
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        such changes shall be deemed approved by such Secretary under
                            section 1082(d)(1) of this title

                        If this subparagraph and subparagraph (A) both apply for any plan year, the plan shall treat any reduction in unfunded accrued liability resulting from the application of this subparagraph as a separate experience amortization base, to be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 30 plan years rather than the period such liability would otherwise be amortized over.
            (C) Solvency test
                (C)
                Solvency test
                    The solvency test under this paragraph is met only if the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period, taking into account the changes in the funding standard account under this paragraph.
            (D) Restriction on benefit increases
                (D)
                Restriction on benefit increases
                If subparagraph (A) or (B) apply to a multiemployer plan for any plan year, then, in addition to any other applicable restrictions on benefit increases, a plan amendment increasing benefits may not go into effect during either of the 2 plan years immediately following such plan year unless—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    the plan actuary certifies that—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        any such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not allocated to the plan immediately before the application of this paragraph to the plan, and
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        the plan’s funded percentage and projected credit balances for such 2 plan years are reasonably expected to be at least as high as such percentage and balances would have been if the benefit increase had not been adopted, or
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.

                    (iii)

                        In general
                            Except as provided in subclause (II), the term “permissible range” means a rate of interest which is not more than 5 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.

                        (I)
                        determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but

                        (II)
                        consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.

                        the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan, or

                        A statement that insolvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would result in benefits lower than benefits paid in the case of plan insolvency.

The regulations under this subparagraph shall provide guidance on the appropriateness of designating default investments that include a mix of asset classes consistent with capital preservation or long-term capital appreciation, or a blend of both.

        (1) In general
            (1)
            In general
            With respect to the selection of an insurer for a guaranteed retirement income contract, the requirements of subsection (a)(1)(B) will be deemed to be satisfied if a fiduciary—
            (A) 
                (A)
                engages in an objective, thorough, and analytical search for the purpose of identifying insurers from which to purchase such contracts;
            (B) 
                (B)
                with respect to each insurer identified under subparagraph (A)—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    considers the financial capability of such insurer to satisfy its obligations under the guaranteed retirement income contract; and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    considers the cost (including fees and commissions) of the guaranteed retirement income contract offered by the insurer in relation to the benefits and product features of the contract and administrative services to be provided under such contract; and
            (C) 
                (C)
                on the basis of such consideration, concludes that—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    at the time of the selection, the insurer is financially capable of satisfying its obligations under the guaranteed retirement income contract; and
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the relative cost of the selected guaranteed retirement income contract as described in subparagraph (B)(ii) is reasonable.
        (2) Financial capability of the insurer
            (2)
            Financial capability of the insurer
            A fiduciary will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (1)(C)(i) if—
            (A) 
                (A)
                the fiduciary obtains written representations from the insurer that—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    the insurer is licensed to offer guaranteed retirement income contracts;
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the insurer, at the time of selection and for each of the immediately preceding 7 plan years—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        operates under a certificate of authority from the insurance commissioner of its domiciliary State which has not been revoked or suspended;
                    (II) 
                        (II)
                        has filed audited financial statements in accordance with the laws of its domiciliary State under applicable statutory accounting principles;
                    (III) 
                        (III)

                    (IV) 
                        (IV)
                        is not operating under an order of supervision, rehabilitation, or liquidation;
                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    the insurer undergoes, at least every 5 years, a financial examination (within the meaning of the law of its domiciliary State) by the insurance commissioner of the domiciliary State (or representative, designee, or other party approved by such commissioner); and
                (iv) 
                    (iv)
                    the insurer will notify the fiduciary of any change in circumstances occurring after the provision of the representations in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) which would preclude the insurer from making such representations at the time of issuance of the guaranteed retirement income contract; and
            (B) 
                (B)
                after receiving such representations and as of the time of selection, the fiduciary has not received any notice described in subparagraph (A)(iv) and is in possession of no other information which would cause the fiduciary to question the representations provided.
        (3) No requirement to select lowest cost
            (3)
            No requirement to select lowest cost
                Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a fiduciary to select the lowest cost contract.

                For purposes of this subsection, the time of selection is—
                (i) 
                    (i)

                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    if the fiduciary periodically reviews the continuing appropriateness of the conclusion described in paragraph (1)(C) with respect to a selected insurer, taking into account the considerations described in such paragraph, the time that the insurer and the contract are selected to provide benefits at future dates to participants or beneficiaries under the plan.
                Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to require the fiduciary to review the appropriateness of a selection after the purchase of a contract for a participant or beneficiary.

                the plan covers only employees of such bank or other institution and employees of affiliates of such bank or other institution, or
            (B) 
                (B)
                such investment is expressly authorized by a provision of the plan or by a fiduciary (other than such bank or institution or affiliate thereof) who is expressly empowered by the plan to so instruct the trustee with respect to such investment.

                such bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of such ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by Federal or State supervisory authority, and
            (B) 
                (B)
                the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.

    (a) Requisite bonding of plan officials
        (a)
        Requisite bonding of plan officials
        Every fiduciary of an employee benefit plan and every person who handles funds or other property of such a plan (hereafter in this section referred to as “plan official”) shall be bonded as provided in this section; except that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            where such plan is one under which the only assets from which benefits are paid are the general assets of a union or of an employer, the administrator, officers, and employees of such plan shall be exempt from the bonding requirements of this section,
        (2) 
            (2)
            1 
            no bond shall be required of any entity which is registered as a broker or a dealer under section 78

        (3) 
            (3)
            no bond shall be required of a fiduciary (or of any director, officer, or employee of such fiduciary) if such fiduciary—
            (A) 
                (A)
                is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State;
            (B) 
                (B)
                is authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers or to conduct an insurance business;
            (C) 
                (C)
                is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority; and
            (D) 
                (D)
                has at all times a combined capital and surplus in excess of such a minimum amount as may be established by regulations issued by the Secretary, which amount shall be at least $1,000,000. Paragraph (2) shall apply to a bank or other financial institution which is authorized to exercise trust powers and the deposits of which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, only if such bank or institution meets bonding or similar requirements under State law which the Secretary determines are at least equivalent to those imposed on banks by Federal law.
            The amount of such bond shall be fixed at the beginning of each fiscal year of the plan. Such amount shall be not less than 10 per centum of the amount of funds handled. In no case shall such bond be less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the Secretary, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to all interested parties, and after consideration of the record, may prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000, subject to the 10 per centum limitation of the preceding sentence. For purposes of fixing the amount of such bond, the amount of funds handled shall be determined by the funds handled by the person, group, or class to be covered by such bond and by their predecessor or predecessors, if any, during the preceding reporting year, or if the plan has no preceding reporting year, the amount of funds to be handled during the current reporting year by such person, group, or class, estimated as provided in regulations of the Secretary. Such bond shall provide protection to the plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the plan official, directly or through connivance with others. Any bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to sections 9304–9308 of title 31. Any bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary, including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class. In the case of a plan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of
                section 1107(d)(1) of this title
                section 1002(43) of this title
    (b) Unlawful acts
        (b)
        Unlawful acts
            It shall be unlawful for any plan official to whom subsection (a) applies, to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of any of the funds or other property of any employee benefit plan, without being bonded as required by subsection (a) and it shall be unlawful for any plan official of such plan, or any other person having authority to direct the performance of such functions, to permit such functions, or any of them, to be performed by any plan official, with respect to whom the requirements of subsection (a) have not been met.
    (c) Conflict of interest prohibited in procuring bonds
        (c)
        Conflict of interest prohibited in procuring bonds
            It shall be unlawful for any person to procure any bond required by subsection (a) from any surety or other company or through any agent or broker in whose business operations such plan or any party in interest in such plan has any control or significant financial interest, direct or indirect.

        (d)
        Exclusiveness of statutory basis for bonding requirement for persons handling funds or other property of employee benefit plans
            Nothing in any other provision of law shall require any person, required to be bonded as provided in subsection (a) because he handles funds or other property of an employee benefit plan, to be bonded insofar as the handling by such person of the funds or other property of such plan is concerned.
    (e) Regulations
        (e)
        Regulations
            The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section including exempting a plan from the requirements of this section where he finds that (1) other bonding arrangements or (2) the overall financial condition of the plan would be adequate to protect the interests of the beneficiaries and participants. When, in the opinion of the Secretary, the administrator of a plan offers adequate evidence of the financial responsibility of the plan, or that other bonding arrangements would provide adequate protection of the beneficiaries and participants, he may exempt such plan from the requirements of this section.

They shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.

                        such person timely submits to the corporation any request for the approval of the bankruptcy court (or other appropriate court in a case under such similar law of a State or political subdivision) of the plan termination, and
                    (IV) 
                        (IV)

                        (I)
                        unless a distress termination occurs, such person will be unable to pay such person’s debts when due and will be unable to continue in business, or

        (2) 
            (2)

        (d)
        Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan

            In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a), the rate of an employer’s contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.

The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation’s risk of loss with respect to the plan.
        (2) 
            (2)
            The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.
§ 1342. Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation
    (a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan
        (a)
        Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan
        The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under
                section 412 of title 26
                section 6212 of title 26
                section 4971(a) of title 26
        (2) 
            (2)
            the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,
        (3) 
            (3)
            the reportable event described in
                section 1343(c)(7) of this title
        (4) 
            (4)
            the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.
        The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c)). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.
    (b) Appointment of trustee
        (b)
        Appointment of trustee
        (1) 
            (1)
            Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.
        (2) 
            (2)
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter—
            (A) 
                (A)
                upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and
            (B) 
                (B)
                upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which
                    section 1341a(d) of this title
        (3) 
            (3)
            The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).
    (c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated
        (c)
        Adjudication that plan must be terminated
        (1) 
            (1)
            If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3). Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.
        (2) 
            (2)
            In the case of a proceeding initiated under this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, upon the request of the corporation, the information described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of

        (1) 
            (1)
            First, to that portion of each individual’s accrued benefit which is derived from the participant’s contributions to the plan which were not mandatory contributions.
        (2) 
            (2)
            Second, to that portion of each individual’s accrued benefit which is derived from the participant’s mandatory contributions.
        (3) 
            (3)
            Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity—
            (A) 
                (A)
                in the case of the benefit of a participant or beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least,
            (B) 
                (B)
                in the case of a participant’s or beneficiary’s benefit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least.
            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.
        (4) 
            (4)
            Fourth—
            (A) 
                (A)
                to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the plan guaranteed under this subchapter (determined without regard to
                    section 1322b(a) of this title
            (B) 
                (B)
                to the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subparagraph (A) if

        (1) 
            (1)
            The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection (a) with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a).
        (2) 
            (2)
            If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection (a) (other than paragraphs (4), (5), and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.
        (3) 
            (3)
            If assets available for allocation under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals who are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated first to benefits described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph. Any remaining assets shall then be allocated to benefits described in subparagraph (B) of that paragraph. If assets allocated to such subparagraph (B) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in that subparagraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that subparagraph.
        (4) 
            (4)
            This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.

                If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.
            (B) 
                (B)
                If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.
        (5) 
            (5)
            If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by
                section 401(a)(4) of title 26

        (7) 
            (7)

            (B) 
                (B)
                A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.
            (C) 
                (C)
                Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in

If a plan has not designated in the summary plan description of the plan an individual as agent for the service of legal process, service upon any contributing sponsor of the plan shall constitute such service. Any money judgment under this section against a single-employer plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in such person’s individual capacity.

                (B)

            (3)
            A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if—

                (A)
                an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and

                    (i)
                    the corporation determines that the plan has suffered substantial damage to its contribution base as a result of such cessation, or

        (4) 
            (4)
            If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the cessation of the employer’s obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in substantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan.

            (A) 
                (A)
                because it determines that the contribution base of the plan has not suffered substantial damage as a result of the cessation of the employer’s obligation to contribute or cessation of covered operations (considered together with any cessation of contribution obligation, or of covered operations, with respect to other employers), or
            (B) 
                (B)
                because it may not make a determination under paragraph (4) because of the last sentence thereof,
            then the bond shall be cancelled or the escrow refunded.
        (6) 
            (6)
            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the amount of the withdrawal liability of any employer.

        Date of complete withdrawal
            For purposes of this part, the date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.

            (A) 
                (A)
                only in industries (or portions thereof) in which, as determined by the corporation, the characteristics that would make use of such rules appropriate are clearly shown, and
            (B) 
                (B)
                only if the corporation determines, in each instance in which special withdrawal liability rules are permitted, that use of such rules will not pose a significant risk to the corporation under this subchapter.
§ 1384. Sale of assets
    (a) Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller
        (a)
        Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller
        (1) 
            (1)
            A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “seller”) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm’s-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “purchaser”), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if—
            (A) 
                (A)
                the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;
            (B) 
                (B)
                the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of
                    section 1112 of this title
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer’s assets occurs, or
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    the annual contribution that the seller was required to make with respect to the operations under the plan for the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the assets occurs,
                which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and
            (C) 
                (C)
                the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.
        (2) 
            (2)
            If the purchaser—
            (A) 
                (A)
                withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and
            (B) 
                (B)
                fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,
            then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.
        (3) 
            (3)
            (A) 
                (A)
                If all, or substantially all, of the seller’s assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.
            (B) 
                (B)
                If only a portion of the seller’s assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).
        (4) 
            (4)
            The liability of the party furnishing a bond or escrow under this subsection shall be reduced, upon payment of the bond or escrow to the plan, by the amount thereof.
    (b) Liability of purchaser
        (b)
        Liability of purchaser
        (1) 
            (1)
            For the purposes of this part, the liability of the purchaser shall be determined as if the purchaser had been required to contribute to the plan in the year of the sale and the 4 plan years preceding the sale the amount the seller was required to contribute for such operations for such 5 plan years.
        (2) 
            (2)
            If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B).
    (c) Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable
        (c)
        Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable
        The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation—
        (1)

                    (ii)
                    an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan with respect to work performed at one or more but fewer than all of its facilities, but continues to perform work at the facility of the type for which the obligation to contribute ceased.

                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.

            In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with respect to such plan—
            (A) 
                (A)
                by substituting “35 percent” for “70 percent” in subsections (a) and (b), and

§ 1386. Adjustment for partial withdrawal; determination of amount; reduction for partial withdrawal liability; procedures applicable
    (a) 
        (a)
        The amount of an employer’s liability for a partial withdrawal, before the application of sections 1399(c)(1) and 1405 of this title, is equal to the product of—
        (1) 
            (1)
            the amount determined under
                section 1391 of this title
                section 1389 of this title
            (A) 
                (A)
                on the date of the partial withdrawal, or
            (B) 
                (B)
                in the case of a partial withdrawal described in
                    section 1385(a)(1) of this title
            multiplied by
        (2) 
            (2)
            a fraction which is 1 minus a fraction—
            (A) 
                (A)
                the numerator of which is the employer’s contribution base units for the plan year following the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, and
            (B) 
                (B)
                the denominator of which is the average of the employer’s contribution base units for—
                (i) 
                    (i)
                    except as provided in clause (ii), the 5 plan years immediately preceding the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, or
                (ii) 
                    (ii)
                    in the case of a partial withdrawal described in

    (b) 
        (b)
        (1) 
            (1)
            In the case of an employer that has withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a plan, any withdrawal liability of that employer for a partial or complete withdrawal from that plan in a subsequent plan year shall be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal liability (reduced by any abatement or reduction of such liability) of the employer with respect to the plan for a previous plan year.
        (2) 
            (2)
            The corporation shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to provide for proper adjustments in the reduction provided by paragraph (1) for—
            (A) 
                (A)
                changes in unfunded vested benefits arising after the close of the prior year for which partial withdrawal liability was determined,
            (B) 
                (B)
                changes in contribution base units occurring after the close of the prior year for which partial withdrawal liability was determined, and
            (C) 
                (C)
                any other factors for which it determines adjustment to be appropriate,
            so that the liability for any complete or partial withdrawal in any subsequent year (after the application of the reduction) properly reflects the employer’s share of liability with respect to the plan.
§ 1387. Reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability; procedures and standards applicable
    (a) 
        (a)
        The corporation shall provide by regulation for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete withdrawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent that the corporation determines that reduction or waiver of withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
    (b) 
        (b)
        The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete withdrawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from the plan subsequently resumes covered operations or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan. The rules may apply only to the extent that the rules are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

                (iii) 
                    (iii)
                    the employer shall continue to make the partial withdrawal liability payments as they are due.

            (B) 
                (B)
                The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard approaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alternative method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan’s unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.

        (2) 
            (2)

        (1) 
            (1)
            to each representative of the affected employees as of the time of the notice or, if there is no such representative at that time, to each affected employee; and

            (1)
            An employer may order the shutdown of a single site of employment before the conclusion of the 60-day period if as of the time that notice would have been required the employer was actively seeking capital or business which, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown and the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.
        (2) 
            (2)
            (A) 
                (A)
                An employer may order a plant closing or mass layoff before the conclusion of the 60-day period if the closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.
            (B) 
                (B)
                No notice under this chapter shall be required if the plant closing or mass layoff is due to any form of natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlands of the United States.
        (3) 
            (3)
            An employer relying on this subsection shall give as much notice as is practicable and at that time shall give a brief statement of the basis for reducing the notification period.
    (c) Extension of layoff period
        (c)
        Extension of layoff period
        A layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to be a layoff of 6 months or less, shall be treated as an employment loss under this chapter unless—
        (1) 
            (1)
            the extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances (including unforeseeable changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff; and
        (2) 
            (2)
            notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond 6 months will be required.
    (d) Determinations with respect to employment loss
        (d)
        Determinations with respect to employment loss
            For purposes of this section, in determining whether a plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur, employment losses for 2 or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which is less than the minimum number of employees specified in section 2101(a)(2) or (3) of this title but which in the aggregate exceed that minimum number, and which occur within any 90-day period shall be considered to be a plant closing or mass layoff unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of this chapter.
§ 2103. Exemptions
    (1) 
        (1)
        the closing is of a temporary facility or the closing or layoff is the result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking; or
    (2) 
        (2)
        the closing or layoff constitutes a strike or constitutes a lockout not intended to evade the requirements of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall require an employer to serve written notice pursuant to

§ 2501. Findings; statement of purpose
    (a) Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            American businesses now and for the remainder of the 20th century will face a dramatically different labor market than the one to which they have become accustomed;
        (2) 
            (2)
            two in every three new entrants to the work force will be women, and to meet labor needs such women must work in all occupational areas including in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
        (3) 
            (3)
            women face significant barriers to their full and effective participation in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
        (4) 
            (4)
            the business community must be prepared to address the barriers that women have to such jobs, in order to successfully integrate them into the work force; and
        (5) 
            (5)
            few resources are available to employers and unions who need assistance in recruiting, training, and retaining women in apprenticeable occupations and other nontraditional occupations.
    (b) Purpose
        (b)
        Purpose
        It is the purpose of this chapter to provide technical assistance to employers and labor unions to encourage employment of women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations. Such assistance will enable business to meet the challenge of Workforce 2000 by preparing employers to successfully recruit, train, and retain women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations and will expand the employment and self-sufficiency options of women. This purpose will be achieved by—
        (1) 
            (1)
            promoting the program to employers and labor unions to inform them of the availability of technical assistance which will assist them in preparing the workplace to employ women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
        (2) 
            (2)
            providing grants to community-based organizations to deliver technical assistance to employers and labor unions to prepare them to recruit, train, and employ women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
        (3) 
            (3)
            authorizing the Department of Labor to serve as a liaison between employers, labor, and the community-based organizations providing technical assistance, through its national office and its regional administrators; and
        (4) 
            (4)
            conducting a comprehensive study to examine the barriers to the participation of women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations and to develop recommendations for the workplace to eliminate such barriers.

§ 2601. Findings and purposes
    (a) Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        Congress finds that—
        (1) 
            (1)
            the number of single-parent households and two-parent households in which the single parent or both parents work is increasing significantly;
        (2) 
            (2)
            it is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early childrearing and the care of family members who have serious health conditions;
        (3) 
            (3)
            the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting;
        (4) 
            (4)
            there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods;
        (5) 
            (5)
            due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men; and
        (6) 
            (6)
            employment standards that apply to one gender only have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.
    (b) Purposes
        (b)
        Purposes
        It is the purpose of this Act—
        (1) 
            (1)
            to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity;
        (2) 
            (2)
            to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;
        (3) 
            (3)
            to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers;
        (4) 
            (4)
            to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons (including maternity-related disability) and for compelling family reasons, on a gender-neutral basis; and
        (5) 
            (5)
            to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to such clause.

§ 2701. Findings
    (1) 
        (1)
        In an increasingly competitive world economy, the companies and nations that lead in the rapid development, commercialization, and application of new and advanced technologies, and in the high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services, will lead in economic growth, employment, and high living standards.
    (2) 
        (2)
        While the United States remains the world leader in science and invention, it has not done well in rapidly making the transition from achievement in its research laboratories to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services. This lag and the unprecedented competitive challenge that the United States has faced from abroad have contributed to a drop in real wages and living standards.
    (3) 
        (3)
        Companies that are successfully competitive in the rapid development, commercialization, application, and implementation of advanced technologies, and in the successful delivery of goods and services, recognize that worker participation and labor-management cooperation in the deployment, application, and implementation of advanced workplace technologies make an important contribution to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services and in maintaining and improving real wages for workers.
    (4) 
        (4)
        The Federal Government has an important role in encouraging and augmenting private sector efforts relating to the development, application, manufacture, and deployment of new and advanced technologies. The role should be to—
        (A) 
            (A)
            work with private companies, States, worker organizations, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education to ensure the development, application, production, and implementation of new and advanced technologies to promote the improvement of workers’ skills, wages, job security, and working conditions, and a healthy environment;
        (B) 
            (B)
            encourage worker and worker organization participation in the development, commercialization, evaluation, selection, application, and implementation of new and advanced technologies in the workplace; and
        (C) 
            (C)
            promote the use and integration of new and advanced technologies in the workplace that enhance workers’ skills.
    (5) 
        (5)
        In working with the private sector to promote the technological leadership and economic growth of the United States, the Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that Federal technology programs help the United States to remain competitive and to maintain and improve living standards and to create and retain secure jobs in economically stable communities.

                (A)
                Definition
                    In this paragraph, the term “covered portion”, used with respect to funding for a fiscal year for a program described in subsection (b)(1), means a portion determined under subparagraph (C) of the Federal funds provided to a State (including local areas within the State) under the Federal law authorizing that program described in subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year (taking into account the availability of funding for purposes related to infrastructure from philanthropic organizations, private entities, or other alternative financing options).
            (B) Partner contributions
                (B)
                Partner contributions
                    Subject to subparagraph (D), for local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), the covered portions of funding for a fiscal year shall be provided to the Governor from the programs described in subsection (b)(1), to assist in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in those local areas of the State not adequately funded under the option described in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).

                    Training services authorized under this paragraph may be provided pursuant to a contract for services in lieu of an individual training account if—
                    (I) 
                        (I)
                        the requirements of subparagraph (F) are met;

                        (II)
                        such services are on-the-job training, customized training, incumbent worker training, or transitional employment;
                    (III) 
                        (III)
                        the local board determines there are an insufficient number of eligible providers of training services in the local area involved (such as in a rural area) to accomplish the purposes of a system of individual training accounts;
                    (IV) 
                        (IV)

                        (aa) 
                            (aa)
                            it would be most appropriate to award a contract to an institution of higher education or other eligible provider of training services in order to facilitate the training of multiple individuals in in-demand industry sectors or occupations; and
                        (bb) 
                            (bb)
                            such contract does not limit customer choice; or
                    (VI) 
                        (VI)
                        the contract is a pay-for-performance contract.
