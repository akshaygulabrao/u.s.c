§ 52. Statutory restriction of injunctive relief
        No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right, of the party making the application, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, and such property or property right must be described with particularity in the application, which must be in writing and sworn to by the applicant or by his agent or attorney.
        And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; or from attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working; or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; or from paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value; or from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and for lawful purposes; or from doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto; nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.

        No court of the United States, as defined in this chapter, shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except in a strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter; nor shall any such restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction be issued contrary to the public policy declared in this chapter.
§ 102. Public policy in labor matters declared
        In the interpretation of this chapter and in determining the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the United States, as such jurisdiction and authority are defined and limited in this chapter, the public policy of the United States is declared as follows:
        Whereas under prevailing economic conditions, developed with the aid of governmental authority for owners of property to organize in the corporate and other forms of ownership association, the individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract and to protect his freedom of labor, and thereby to obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment, wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing, to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection; therefore, the following definitions of, and limitations upon, the jurisdiction and authority of the courts of the United States are enacted.

            section 103 of this title
§ 105. Doing in concert of certain acts as constituting unlawful combination or conspiracy subjecting person to injunctive remedies

                Provided, however
            The undertaking mentioned in this section shall be understood to signify an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which a decree may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against said complainant and surety, upon a hearing to assess damages of which hearing complainant and surety shall have reasonable notice, the said complainant and surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for that purpose.

        This chapter may be cited as the “Labor Management Relations Act, 1947”.
        (b)
        Industrial strife which interferes with the normal flow of commerce and with the full production of articles and commodities for commerce, can be avoided or substantially minimized if employers, employees, and labor organizations each recognize under law one another’s legitimate rights in their relations with each other, and above all recognize under law that neither party has any right in its relations with any other to engage in acts or practices which jeopardize the public health, safety, or interest.
            It is the purpose and policy of this chapter, in order to promote the full flow of commerce, to prescribe the legitimate rights of both employees and employers in their relations affecting commerce, to provide orderly and peaceful procedures for preventing the interference by either with the legitimate rights of the other, to protect the rights of individual employees in their relations with labor organizations whose activities affect commerce, to define and proscribe practices on the part of labor and management which affect commerce and are inimical to the general welfare, and to protect the rights of the public in connection with labor disputes affecting commerce.
§ 142. Definitions
        (1)
        The term “industry affecting commerce” means any industry or activity in commerce or in which a labor dispute would burden or obstruct commerce or tend to burden or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce.
        (2)
        The term “strike” includes any strike or other concerted stoppage of work by employees (including a stoppage by reason of the expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement) and any concerted slowdown or other concerted interruption of operations by employees.
        (3)
        The terms “commerce”, “labor disputes”, “employer”, “employee”, “labor organization”, “representative”, “person”, and “supervisor” shall have the same meaning as when used in subchapter II of this chapter.
§ 143. Saving provisions
        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require an individual employee to render labor or service without his consent, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to make the quitting of his labor by an individual employee an illegal act; nor shall any court issue any process to compel the performance by an individual employee of such labor or service, without his consent; nor shall the quitting of labor by an employee or employees in good faith because of abnormally dangerous conditions for work at the place of employment of such employee or employees be deemed a strike under this chapter.
§ 144. Separability
        If any provision of this chapter, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, shall be held invalid, the remainder of this chapter, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.
§ 151. Findings and declaration of policy
        The denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce.
        The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.
        Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.
        Experience has further demonstrated that certain practices by some labor organizations, their officers, and members have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by preventing the free flow of goods in such commerce through strikes and other forms of industrial unrest or through concerted activities which impair the interest of the public in the free flow of such commerce. The elimination of such practices is a necessary condition to the assurance of the rights herein guaranteed.
        It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

                (B)
                by an employer, alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations have presented to him a claim to be recognized as the representative defined in subsection (a);

§ 202. Congressional finding and declaration of policy
        (a)
        The Congress finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce. That Congress further finds that the employment of persons in domestic service in households affects commerce.
        (b)
        It is declared to be the policy of this chapter, through the exercise by Congress of its power to regulate commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, to correct and as rapidly as practicable to eliminate the conditions above referred to in such industries without substantially curtailing employment or earning power.

            The Secretary, to the extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, shall by special certificate issued under a regulation or order provide for the employment, at a wage rate not less than 85 per centum of the wage rate in effect under section 206(a)(5)

                section 206 of this title
            (4)
                (A)
                A special certificate issued under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall provide that the student or students for whom it is issued shall, except during vacation periods, be employed on a part-time basis and not in excess of twenty hours in any workweek.
                (B)
                If the issuance of a special certificate under paragraph (1) or (2) for an employer will cause the number of students employed by such employer under special certificates issued under this subsection to exceed six, the Secretary may not issue such a special certificate for the employment of a student by such employer unless the Secretary finds employment of such student will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those employed under special certificates issued under this subsection. If the issuance of a special certificate under paragraph (1) or (2) for an employer will not cause the number of students employed by such employer under special certificates issued under this subsection to exceed six—
                    (i)
                    the Secretary may issue a special certificate under paragraph (1) or (2) for the employment of a student by such employer if such employer certifies to the Secretary that the employment of such student will not reduce the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those employed under special certificates issued under this subsection, and

                    in the case of an employer which is a retail or service establishment, subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the issuance of special certificates for such employer under such paragraph.

                (C)
                No special certificate may be issued under this subsection unless the employer for whom the certificate is to be issued provides evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of the student status of the employees to be employed under such special certificate.
                (D)
                To minimize paperwork for, and to encourage, small businesses to employ students under special certificates issued under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall, by regulation or order, prescribe a simplified application form to be used by employers in applying for such a certificate for the employment of not more than six full-time students. Such an application shall require only—
                    (i)
                    a listing of the name, address, and business of the applicant employer,
                    (ii)
                    a listing of the date the applicant began business, and
                    (iii)
                    the certification that the employment of such full-time students will not reduce the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than persons employed under special certificates.

        (c)
        Handicapped workers
            (1)
            The Secretary, to the extent necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, shall by regulation or order provide for the employment, under special certificates, of individuals (including individuals employed in agriculture) whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury, at wages which are—
                (A)
                lower than the minimum wage applicable under
                    section 206 of this title
                (B)
                commensurate with those paid to nonhandicapped workers, employed in the vicinity in which the individuals under the certificates are employed, for essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work, and
                (C)
                related to the individual’s productivity.
            (2)
            The Secretary shall not issue a certificate under paragraph (1) unless the employer provides written assurances to the Secretary that—
                (A)
                in the case of individuals paid on an hourly rate basis, wages paid in accordance with paragraph (1) will be reviewed by the employer at periodic intervals at least once every six months, and
                (B)
                wages paid in accordance with paragraph (1) will be adjusted by the employer at periodic intervals, at least once each year, to reflect changes in the prevailing wage paid to experienced nonhandicapped individuals employed in the locality for essentially the same type of work.
            (3)
            Notwithstanding paragraph (1), no employer shall be permitted to reduce the hourly wage rate prescribed by certificate under this subsection in effect on
                June 1, 1986
            (4)
            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit an employer from maintaining or establishing work activities centers to provide therapeutic activities for handicapped clients.
            (5)
                (A)
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, any employee receiving a special minimum wage at a rate specified pursuant to this subsection or the parent or guardian of such an employee may petition the Secretary to obtain a review of such special minimum wage rate. An employee or the employee’s parent or guardian may file such a petition for and in behalf of the employee or in behalf of the employee and other employees similarly situated. No employee may be a party to any such action unless the employee or the employee’s parent or guardian gives consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed with the Secretary.
                (B)
                Upon receipt of a petition filed in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Secretary within ten days shall assign the petition to an administrative law judge appointed pursuant to
                    section 3105 of title 5
                    section 554 of title 5
                (C)
                In any such proceeding, the employer shall have the burden of demonstrating that the special minimum wage rate is justified as necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment.
                (D)
                In determining whether any special minimum wage rate is justified pursuant to subparagraph (C), the administrative law judge shall consider—
                    (i)
                    the productivity of the employee or employees identified in the petition and the conditions under which such productivity was measured; and
                    (ii)
                    the productivity of other employees performing work of essentially the same type and quality for other employers in the same vicinity.
                (E)
                The administrative law judge shall issue a decision within thirty days after the hearing provided for in subparagraph (B). Such action shall be deemed to be a final agency action unless within thirty days the Secretary grants a request to review the decision of the administrative law judge. Either the petitioner or the employer may request review by the Secretary within fifteen days of the date of issuance of the decision by the administrative law judge.
                (F)
                The Secretary, within thirty days after receiving a request for review, shall review the record and either adopt the decision of the administrative law judge or issue exceptions. The decision of the administrative law judge, together with any exceptions, shall be deemed to be a final agency action.
                (G)
                A final agency action shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 7 of title 5. An action seeking such review shall be brought within thirty days of a final agency action described in subparagraph (F).

            The Congress further finds and declares that all of the results which have arisen or may arise under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, as aforesaid, may (except as to liability for liquidated damages) arise with respect to the Walsh-Healey and Bacon-Davis Acts

    Standards for labor-management relations
        (a)
        Standards for labor-management relations
            The Congress finds that, in the public interest, it continues to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect employees’ rights to organize, choose their own representatives, bargain collectively, and otherwise engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection; that the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation; and that in order to accomplish the objective of a free flow of commerce it is essential that labor organizations, employers, and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations, particularly as they affect labor-management relations.
    Protection of rights of employees and the public
        (b)
        Protection of rights of employees and the public
            The Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.
    Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practices
        (c)
        Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practices
            The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that the enactment of this chapter is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended [

No such proceeding shall be brought except upon leave of the court obtained upon verified application and for good cause shown, which application may be made ex parte.

Such bonds shall be individual or schedule in form, and shall have a corporate surety company as surety thereon. Any person who is not covered by such bonds shall not be permitted to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of the funds or other property of a labor organization or of a trust in which a labor organization is interested. No such bond shall be placed through an agent or broker or with a surety company in which any labor organization or any officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative of a labor organization has any direct or indirect interest.

§ 621. Congressional statement of findings and purpose
        (a)
        The Congress hereby finds and declares that—
            (1)
            in the face of rising productivity and affluence, older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs;
            (2)
            the setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance has become a common practice, and certain otherwise desirable practices may work to the disadvantage of older persons;
            (3)
            the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant deterioration of skill, morale, and employer acceptability is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing; and their employment problems grave;
            (4)
            the existence in industries affecting commerce, of arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age, burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce.
        (b)
        It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.
§ 622. Education and research program; recommendation to Congress
        (a)
        The Secretary of Labor shall undertake studies and provide information to labor unions, management, and the general public concerning the needs and abilities of older workers, and their potentials for continued employment and contribution to the economy. In order to achieve the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary of Labor shall carry on a continuing program of education and information, under which he may, among other measures—
            (1)
            undertake research, and promote research, with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons, and the promotion of measures for utilizing their skills;
            (2)
            publish and otherwise make available to employers, professional societies, the various media of communication, and other interested persons the findings of studies and other materials for the promotion of employment;
            (3)
            foster through the public employment service system and through cooperative effort the development of facilities of public and private agencies for expanding the opportunities and potentials of older persons;
            (4)
            sponsor and assist State and community informational and educational programs.
        (b)
        Not later than six months after the effective date of this chapter, the Secretary shall recommend to the Congress any measures he may deem desirable to change the lower or upper age limits set forth in
            section 631 of this title

            (2)
            The prohibitions of this section shall not apply where the employer is a foreign person not controlled by an American employer.
            (3)

                    (i)
                        In general
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) if a participant’s accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.
                    (ii)
                        Similarly situated
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.

                            In general
                        An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.
                        (II)
                            Preservation of capital
                        An interest credit (or an equivalent amount) of less than zero shall in no event result in the account balance or similar amount being less than the aggregate amount of contributions credited to the account.

                            Market rate of return
                        The Secretary of the Treasury may provide by regulation for rules governing the calculation of a market rate of return for purposes of subclause (I) and for permissible methods of crediting interest to the account (including fixed or variable interest rates) resulting in effective rates of return meeting the requirements of subclause (I). In the case of a governmental plan (as defined in the first sentence of

                        (I)
                        the participant’s accrued benefit for years of service before the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect before the amendment, plus
                        (II)
                        the participant’s accrued benefit for years of service after the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment.

                        If the benefits of 2 or more defined benefit plans established or maintained by an employer are coordinated in such a manner as to have the effect of the adoption of an amendment described in subclause (I), the sponsor of the defined benefit plan or plans providing for such coordination shall be treated as having adopted such a plan amendment as of the date such coordination begins.
                        (III)
                            Multiple amendments
                        The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subparagraph through the use of 2 or more plan amendments rather than a single amendment.
                        (IV)
                            Applicable defined benefit plan

                        if the interest credit rate (or an equivalent amount) under the plan is a variable rate, the rate of interest used to determine accrued benefits under the plan shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest used under the plan during the 5-year period ending on the termination date, and
                        (II)
                        the interest rate and mortality table used to determine the amount of any benefit under the plan payable in the form of an annuity payable at normal retirement age shall be the rate and table specified under the plan for such purpose as of the termination date, except that if such interest rate is a variable rate, the interest rate shall be determined under the rules of subclause (I).
                (C)
                    Certain offsets permitted
                A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) solely because the plan provides offsets against benefits under the plan to the extent such offsets are allowable in applying the requirements of
                    section 401(a) of title 26
                (D)

                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) solely because the plan provides for indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.

                If an employer that has implemented a deduction pursuant to subparagraph (A) fails to fulfill the obligation described in subparagraph (E), any aggrieved individual may bring an action for specific performance of the obligation described in subparagraph (E). The relief shall be in addition to any other remedies provided under Federal or State law.
            (3)
            It shall not be a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (e) solely because an employer provides a bona fide employee benefit plan or plans under which long-term disability benefits received by an individual are reduced by any pension benefits (other than those attributable to employee contributions)—
                (A)
                paid to the individual that the individual voluntarily elects to receive; or
                (B)

            (3)
            any employee who attains the minimum age and satisfies all non-age-based conditions for receiving a benefit under the plan has an opportunity lasting not less than 180 days to elect to retire and to receive the maximum benefit that could then be elected by a younger but otherwise similarly situated employee, and the plan does not require retirement to occur sooner than 180 days after such election.

            (6)

    Procedure for promulgation, modification, or revocation of standards
        (b)
        Procedure for promulgation, modification, or revocation of standards
        The Secretary may by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety or health standard in the following manner:
            (1)
            Whenever the Secretary, upon the basis of information submitted to him in writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees, a nationally recognized standards-producing organization, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or a State or political subdivision, or on the basis of information developed by the Secretary or otherwise available to him, determines that a rule should be promulgated in order to serve the objectives of this chapter, the Secretary may request the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed under
                section 656 of this title
            (2)
            The Secretary shall publish a proposed rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard in the Federal Register and shall afford interested persons a period of thirty days after publication to submit written data or comments. Where an advisory committee is appointed and the Secretary determines that a rule should be issued, he shall publish the proposed rule within sixty days after the submission of the advisory committee’s recommendations or the expiration of the period prescribed by the Secretary for such submission.
            (3)
            On or before the last day of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), any interested person may file with the Secretary written objections to the proposed rule, stating the grounds therefor and requesting a public hearing on such objections. Within thirty days after the last day for filing such objections, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice specifying the occupational safety or health standard to which objections have been filed and a hearing requested, and specifying a time and place for such hearing.
            (4)
            Within sixty days after the expiration of the period provided for the submission of written data or comments under paragraph (2), or within sixty days after the completion of any hearing held under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall issue a rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard or make a determination that a rule should not be issued. Such a rule may contain a provision delaying its effective date for such period (not in excess of ninety days) as the Secretary determines may be necessary to insure that affected employers and employees will be informed of the existence of the standard and of its terms and that employers affected are given an opportunity to familiarize themselves and their employees with the existence of the requirements of the standard.
            (5)
            The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.

Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of clause (B) and establishes that (i) he is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, (ii) he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (iii) he has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable. Any temporary order issued under this paragraph shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail his program for coming into compliance with the standard. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing:
                    Provided
                (B)
                An application for a temporary order under this paragraph (6) shall contain:
                    (i)

            (2)
            Such standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard promulgated in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subsection.
            (3)

Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The Secretary shall issue such rule or order if he determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, or by the Secretary on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.

§ 701. Findings; purpose; policy
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        Congress finds that—
            (1)
            millions of Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities and the number of Americans with such disabilities is increasing;
            (2)
            individuals with disabilities constitute one of the most disadvantaged groups in society;
            (3)
            disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to—
                (A)
                live independently;
                (B)
                enjoy self-determination;
                (C)
                make choices;
                (D)
                contribute to society;
                (E)
                pursue meaningful careers; and
                (F)
                enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society;
            (4)
            increased employment of individuals with disabilities can be achieved through implementation of statewide workforce development systems defined in
                section 3102 of this title
            (5)
            individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and public services;
            (6)
            the goals of the Nation properly include the goal of providing individuals with disabilities with the tools necessary to—
                (A)
                make informed choices and decisions; and
                (B)
                achieve equality of opportunity, full inclusion and integration in society, employment, independent living, and economic and social self-sufficiency, for such individuals; and
            (7)
                (A)
                a high proportion of students with disabilities is leaving secondary education without being employed in competitive integrated employment, or being enrolled in postsecondary education; and
                (B)
                there is a substantial need to support such students as they transition from school to postsecondary life.

            (3)
            to ensure that the Federal Government plays a leadership role in promoting the employment of individuals with disabilities, especially individuals with significant disabilities, and in assisting States and providers of services in fulfilling the aspirations of such individuals with disabilities for meaningful and gainful employment and independent living;
            (4)
            to increase employment opportunities and employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities, including through encouraging meaningful input by employers and vocational rehabilitation service providers on successful and prospective employment and placement strategies; and

        Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the President, and to the extent consistent with the other provisions of this chapter, where funds are provided for a single project by more than one Federal agency to an agency or organization assisted under this chapter, the Federal agency principally involved may be designated to act for all in administering the funds provided, and, in such cases, a single non-Federal share requirement may be established according to the proportion of funds advanced by each agency.

§ 718. Traditionally underserved populations
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:
        Racial profile
            (1)
            Racial profile
                The demographic profile of America is rapidly changing. While the percentage increase from 2000 to 2010 for white Americans was 9.7 percent, the percentage increase for racial and ethnic minorities was much higher: 43.0 percent for Latinos, 12.3 percent for African-Americans, and 43.2 percent for Asian-Americans.
        Rate of disability
            (2)
            Rate of disability
            Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. In 2011—
                (A)
                among Americans ages 16 through 64, the rate of disability was 12.1 percent;
                (B)
                among African-Americans in that age range, the disability rate was more than twice as high, at 27.1 percent; and
                (C)
                for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the same age range, the disability rate was also more than twice as high, at 27.0 percent.
        Inequitable treatment
            (3)
            Inequitable treatment
                Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.
        Recruitment
            (4)
            Recruitment
                Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.
    Outreach to minorities
        (b)
        Outreach to minorities

                (C)
                Making awards to entities described in paragraph (3) to provide outreach and technical assistance to minority entities and Indian tribes to promote their participation in activities funded under this chapter, including assistance to enhance their capacity to carry out such activities.

            In this subsection:
            Historically Black college or university

            (1)
            Findings
            Congress finds that—
                (A)
                work—
                    (i)
                    is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and
                    (ii)
                    fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;
                (B)
                as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;
                (C)
                individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in competitive integrated employment settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;
                (D)
                reasons for significant numbers of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include—
                    (i)
                    discrimination;
                    (ii)
                    lack of accessible and available transportation;
                    (iii)
                    fear of losing health coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs carried out under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (
                        42 U.S.C. 1395
                    (iv)
                    lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;
                (E)
                enforcement of subchapter V and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (
                    42 U.S.C. 12101
                (F)
                the provision of workforce development activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and
                (G)
                linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs established under this subchapter and other components of the statewide workforce development systems are critical to ensure effective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities in workforce development activities.
        Purpose
            (2)
            Purpose
            The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is—
                (A)
                an integral part of a statewide workforce development system; and
                (B)
                designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, informed choice, and economic self-sufficiency, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.
        Policy
            (3)
            Policy
            It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:
                (A)
                Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.
                (B)
                Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain competitive integrated employment.
                (C)
                Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices—
                    (i)
                    during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and
                    (ii)
                    in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.
                (D)
                Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.
                (E)
                Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and prepared in accordance with State policies and procedures as described in
                    section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title
                (F)
                Individuals with disabilities and the individuals’ representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.
                (G)
                Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.

    Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing power
        (a)
        Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing power
            The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.
    Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries
        (b)
        Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries
            It is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.
    Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance
        (c)
        Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance
            It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.
§ 1001a. Additional Congressional findings and declaration of policy
    Effects of multiemployer pension plans
        (a)
        Effects of multiemployer pension plans
        The Congress finds that—
            (1)
            multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;
            (2)
            multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;
            (3)
            the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and
            (4)
                (A)
                withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and
                (B)
                in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.
    Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program
        (b)
        Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program
        The Congress further finds that—
            (1)
            it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and
            (2)
            it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.
    Policy
        (c)
        Policy
        It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act—
            (1)
            to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,
            (2)
            to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,
            (3)
            to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and
            (4)
            to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.
§ 1001b. Findings and declaration of policy
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds that—
            (1)
            single-employer defined benefit pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national interest;
            (2)
            the continued well-being and retirement income security of millions of workers, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by such plans;
            (3)
            the existence of a sound termination insurance system is fundamental to the retirement income security of participants and beneficiaries of such plans; and
            (4)
            the current termination insurance system in some instances encourages employers to terminate pension plans, evade their obligations to pay benefits, and shift unfunded pension liabilities onto the termination insurance system and the other premium-payers.
    Additional findings
        (b)
        Additional findings
        The Congress further finds that modification of the current termination insurance system and an increase in the insurance premium for single-employer defined benefit pension plans—
            (1)
            is desirable to increase the likelihood that full benefits will be paid to participants and beneficiaries of such plans;
            (2)
            is desirable to provide for the transfer of liabilities to the termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;
            (3)
            is necessary to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and
            (4)
            is necessary to finance properly current funding deficiencies and future obligations of the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system.
    Declaration of policy
        (c)
        Declaration of policy
        It is hereby declared to be the policy of this title—
            (1)
            to foster and facilitate interstate commerce;
            (2)
            to encourage the maintenance and growth of single-employer defined benefit pension plans;
            (3)
            to increase the likelihood that participants and beneficiaries under single-employer defined benefit pension plans will receive their full benefits;
            (4)
            to provide for the transfer of unfunded pension liabilities onto the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system only in cases of severe hardship;
            (5)
            to maintain the premium costs of such system at a reasonable level; and
            (6)
            to assure the prudent financing of current funding deficiencies and future obligations of the single-employer pension plan termination insurance system by increasing termination insurance premiums.

                        explains that the actual payments under the lifetime income stream described in clause (i)(III) which may be purchased with the total benefits accrued will depend on numerous factors and may vary substantially from the lifetime income stream equivalent in the disclosures;
                        (III)
                        explains the assumptions upon which the lifetime income stream equivalent was determined; and

                        provides such other similar explanations as the Secretary considers appropriate.

                        (I)
                        prescribe assumptions which administrators of individual account plans may use in converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents for purposes of this subparagraph; and
                        (II)
                        issue interim final rules under clause (i).
                In prescribing assumptions under subclause (I), the Secretary may prescribe a single set of specific assumptions (in which case the Secretary may issue tables or factors which facilitate such conversions), or ranges of permissible assumptions. To the extent that an accrued benefit is or may be invested in a lifetime income stream described in clause (i)(III), the assumptions prescribed under subclause (I) shall, to the extent appropriate, permit administrators of individual account plans to use the amounts payable under such lifetime income stream as a lifetime income stream equivalent.
                Limitation on liability
                    (iv)
                    Limitation on liability
                        No plan fiduciary, plan sponsor, or other person shall have any liability under this subchapter solely by reason of the provision of lifetime income stream equivalents which are derived in accordance with the assumptions and rules described in clause (iii) and which include the explanations contained in the model lifetime income disclosure described in clause (ii). This clause shall apply without regard to whether the provision of such lifetime income stream equivalent is required by subparagraph (B)(iii).
                Effective date
                    (v)
                    Effective date

                        (I)
                        interim final rules under clause (i);
                        (II)
                        the model disclosure under clause (ii); or

Such notice may be delivered in written, electronic, or other appropriate form to the extent such form is reasonably accessible to the participant.
            Years in which no benefits accrue
                (B)

                    (i)
                    In the case of any plan which provides that after not more than 2 years of service each participant has a right to 100 percent of his accrued benefit under the plan which is nonforfeitable at the time such benefit accrues, clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting “2 years of service” for “1 year of service”.

                For purposes of this section, the term “year of service” means a 12-month period during which the employee has not less than 1,000 hours of service. For purposes of this paragraph, computation of any 12-month period shall be made with reference to the date on which the employee’s employment commenced, except that, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such computation may be made by reference to the first day of a plan year in the case of an employee who does not complete 1,000 hours of service during the 12-month period beginning on the date his employment commenced.
                (B)
                In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term “year of service” shall be such period as may be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
                (C)
                For purposes of this section, the term “hour of service” means a time of service determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

            (4)
            A plan shall be treated as not meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) unless it provides that any employee who has satisfied the minimum age and service requirements specified in such paragraph, and who is otherwise entitled to participate in the plan, commences participation in the plan no later than the earlier of—
                (A)
                the first day of the first plan year beginning after the date on which such employee satisfied such requirements, or

                (A)
                For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of a nonvested participant, years of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan before any period of consecutive 1-year breaks in service shall not be required to be taken into account in computing the period of service if the number of consecutive 1-year breaks in service within such period equals or exceeds the greater of—
                    (i)
                    5, or
                    (ii)

                If any years of service are not required to be taken into account by reason of a period of breaks in service to which subparagraph (A) applies, such years of service shall not be taken into account in applying subparagraph (A) to a subsequent period of breaks in service.

                    (ii)
                    by reason of the birth of a child of the individual,
                    (iii)
                    by reason of the placement of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual, or
                    (iv)
                    for purposes of caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following such birth or placement,
                the plan shall treat as hours of service, solely for purposes of determining under this subsection whether a 1-year break in service (as defined in
                    section 1053(b)(3)(A) of this title
                (B)

                    (ii)
                    in any case in which the plan is unable to determine the hours described in clause (i), 8 hours of service per day of such absence,
                except that the total number of hours treated as hours of service under this subparagraph by reason of any such pregnancy or placement shall not exceed 501 hours.

                    (i)
                    only in the year in which the absence from work begins, if a participant would be prevented from incurring a 1-year break in service in such year solely because the period of absence is treated as hours of service as provided in subparagraph (A); or
                    (ii)
                    in any other case, in the immediately following year.

                (E)

                    that the absence from work is for reasons referred to in subparagraph (A), and

                (B)
                For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of any employee who has any 1-year break in service, years of service before such break shall not be required to be taken into account until he has completed a year of service after his return.
                (C)
                For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of any participant in an individual account plan or an insured defined benefit plan which satisfies the requirements of sub

                (D)
                    (i)
                    For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of a nonvested participant, years of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan before any period of consecutive 1-year breaks in service shall not be required to be taken into account if the number of consecutive 1-year breaks in service within such period equals or exceeds the greater of—
                        (I)
                        5, or
                        (II)

                    If any years of service are not required to be taken into account by reason of a period of breaks in service to which clause (i) applies, such years of service shall not be taken into account in applying clause (i) to a subsequent period of breaks in service.
                    (iii)
                    For purposes of clause (i), the term “nonvested participant” means a participant who does not have any nonforfeitable right under the plan to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions.

                        (I)
                        by reason of the pregnancy of the individual,
                        (II)
                        by reason of the birth of a child of the individual,
                        (III)
                        by reason of the placement of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual, or
                        (IV)
                        for purposes of caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following such birth or placement,
                    the plan shall treat as hours of service, solely for purposes of determining under this paragraph whether a 1-year break in service has occurred, the hours described in clause (ii).
                    (ii)
                    The hours described in this clause are—
                        (I)
                        the hours of service which otherwise would normally have been credited to such individual but for such absence, or
                        (II)
                        in any case in which the plan is unable to determine the hours described in subclause (I), 8 hours of service per day of absence,
                    except that the total number of hours treated as hours of service under this clause by reason of such pregnancy or placement shall not exceed 501 hours.
                    (iii)
                    The hours described in clause (ii) shall be treated as hours of service as provided in this subparagraph—
                        (I)
                        only in the year in which the absence from work begins, if a participant would be prevented from incurring a 1-year break in service in such year solely because the period of absence is treated as hours of service as provided in clause (i); or
                        (II)
                        in any other case, in the immediately following year.

                    (v)
                    A plan may provide that no credit will be given pursuant to this subparagraph unless the individual furnishes to the plan administrator such timely information as the plan may reasonably require to establish—
                        (I)
                        that the absence from work is for reasons referred to in clause (i), and
                        (II)
                        the number of days for which there was such an absence.

                (A)
                A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(2) if the nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (determined as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted, or the date such amendment becomes effective) of any employee who is a participant in the plan is less than such nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan without regard to such amendment.
                (B)
                A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(2) unless each participant having not less than 3 years of service is permitted to elect, within a reasonable period after adoption of such amendment, to have his nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan without regard to such amendment.
            (2)
            Subsection (a) shall not apply to benefits which may not be provided for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to preclude the discrimination prohibited by

§ 1054. Benefit accrual requirements
    Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans
        (a)
        Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans
        Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3), and—
            (1)
            in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1); and
            (2)
            in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2).
    Enumeration of plan requirements
        (b)
        Enumeration of plan requirements
            (1)
                (A)
                A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than—
                    (i)
                    3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by
                    (ii)
                    the number of years (not in excess of 33⅓) of his participation in the plan.
                In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
                (B)
                A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 133⅓ percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph—
                    (i)
                    any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;
                    (ii)
                    any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;
                    (iii)
                    the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and
                    (iv)
                    social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.
                (C)
                A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
                (D)
                Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of—
                    (i)
                    his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to
                        September 2, 1974
                    (ii)
                    an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.
                (E)
                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “year of service” has the meaning provided by
                    section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title
                (F)
                Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan
                    (i)
                    is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and
                    (ii)
                    satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of
                        section 1081(b) of this title
                but only if an employee’s accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of
                    section 1081(b) of this title
                (G)
                Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant’s accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [
                    42 U.S.C. 401
                    (i)
                    do not exceed social security benefits, and
                    (ii)
                    terminate when such social security benefits commence.
                (H)
                    (i)
                    Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee’s benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee’s benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.
                    (ii)
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.
                    (iii)
                    In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan—
                        (I)
                        if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and
                        (II)
                        if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with
                            section 1056(a)(3) of this title
                            section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title
                    The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.
                    (iv)
                    Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of
                        section 414(q) of title 26
                    (v)
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.
                    (vi)
                    Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of
                        section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26
            (2)
                (A)
                A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee’s account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee’s account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.
                (B)
                A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.
                (C)
                Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of
                    section 411(b)(2) of title 26
            (3)
            A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if—
                (A)
                in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee’s accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and
                (B)
                in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee’s accrued benefit.
            (4)
                (A)
                For purposes of determining an employee’s accrued benefit, the term “year of participation” means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under
                    section 1052(b) of this title
                    section 1052(b)(5) of this title
                (B)
                For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee’s service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.
                (C)
                For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.
                (D)
                In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term “year of participation” shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
                (E)
                For purposes of this subsection in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.

                    Comparison to similarly situated younger individual.—
                    (i)
                        In general
                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) if a participant’s accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.
                    (ii)
                        Similarly situated
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.
                    (iii)
                        Disregard of subsidized early retirement benefits

                    (iv)
                        Accrued benefit
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the accrued benefit may, under the terms of the plan, be expressed as an annuity payable at normal retirement age, the balance of a hypothetical account, or the current value of the accumulated percentage of the employee’s final average compensation.

                        An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.
                        (II)
                            Preservation of capital
                        An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the plan provides that an interest credit (or equivalent amount) of less than zero shall in no event result in the account balance or similar amount being less than the aggregate amount of contributions credited to the account.
                        (III)
                            Market rate of return
                        The Secretary of the Treasury may provide by regulation for rules governing the calculation of a market rate of return for purposes of subclause (I) and for permissible methods of crediting interest to the account (including fixed or variable interest rates) resulting in effective rates of return meeting the requirements of subclause (I).
                    (ii)
                        Special rule for plan conversions

                    Subject to clause (iv), the requirements of this clause are met with respect to any participant if the accrued benefit of the participant under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment is not less than the sum of—
                        (I)
                        the participant’s accrued benefit for years of service before the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect before the amendment, plus
                        (II)
                        the participant’s accrued benefit for years of service after the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment.

                        Special rules for early retirement subsidies
                    For purposes of clause (iii)(I), the plan shall credit the accumulation account or similar amount

                            Special rule for coordinated benefits
                        If the benefits of 2 or more defined benefit plans established or maintained by an employer are coordinated in such a manner as to have the effect of the adoption of an amendment described in subclause (I), the sponsor of the defined benefit plan or plans providing for such coordination shall be treated as having adopted such a plan amendment as of the date such coordination begins.
                        (III)
                            Multiple amendments
                        The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subparagraph through the use of 2 or more plan amendments rather than a single amendment.
                        (IV)
                            Applicable defined benefit plan
                        For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “applicable defined benefit plan” has the meaning given such term by

                        Termination requirements
                    An applicable defined benefit plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) unless the plan provides that, upon the termination of the plan—
                        (I)
                        if the interest credit rate (or an equivalent amount) under the plan is a variable rate, the rate of interest used to determine accrued benefits under the plan shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest used under the plan during the 5-year period ending on the termination date, and
                        (II)
                        the interest rate and mortality table used to determine the amount of any benefit under the plan payable in the form of an annuity payable at normal retirement age shall be the rate and table specified under the plan for such purpose as of the termination date, except that if such interest rate is a variable rate, the interest rate shall be determined under the rules of subclause (I).
                (C)
                    Certain offsets permitted
                A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) solely because the plan provides offsets against benefits under the plan to the extent such offsets are otherwise allowable in applying the requirements of
                    section 401(a) of title 26
                (D)
                    Permitted disparities in plan contributions or benefits

                    A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides for indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.
                    (ii)
                        Protection against loss
                    Except in the case of any benefit provided in the form of a variable annuity, clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any indexing which results in an accrued benefit less than the accrued benefit determined without regard to such indexing.
                    (iii)
                        Indexing
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “indexing” means, in connection with an accrued benefit, the periodic adjustment of the accrued benefit by means of the application of a recognized investment index or methodology.

                    if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee’s contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee’s contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).
                (B)
                    Defined benefit plans
                In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee’s accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under
                    section 1055(g)(3) of this title
                (C)
                For purposes of this subsection, the term “accumulated contributions” means the total of—

                        at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under
                            section 1274 of title 26
                        (II)
                        at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under
                            section 1055(g)(3) of this title

                (D)
                The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.
            (3)
            For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee’s accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee’s accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).
            (4)
            In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee’s accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.
    Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee’s accrued benefits under plan
        (d)
        Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee’s accrued benefits under plan
        Notwithstanding
            section 1053(b)(1) of this title
            (1)
            a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under
                section 1053(e)(1) of this title
            (2)
            a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive.
        Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
    Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service
        (e)
        Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service
        For purposes of determining the employee’s accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) and provides that upon such repayment the employee’s accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who—
            (1)
            received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,
            (2)
            resumes employment covered under the plan, and
            (3)
            repays the full amount of such distribution with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C).
        The plan provision required under this subsection may provide that such repayment must be made (A) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (B) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.
    Employer treated as maintaining a plan
        (f)
        Employer treated as maintaining a plan
            For the purposes of this part, an employer shall be treated as maintaining a plan if any employee of such employer accrues benefits under such plan by reason of service with such employer.
    Decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan
        (g)
        Decrease of accrued benefits through amendment of plan
            (1)
            The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 1082(d)(2) or 1441 of this title.
            (2)
            For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan amendment which has the effect of—
                (A)
                eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or
                (B)
                eliminating an optional form of benefit,
            with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide that this paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in subparagraph (B) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in subparagraph (A)).
            (3)
            For purposes of this subsection, any—
                (A)
                tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined in
                    section 409(a) of title 26
                (B)

                    section 4975(e)(7) of title 26
            shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because it modifies distribution options in a nondiscriminatory manner.
            (4)
                (A)
                A defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the “transferee plan”) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because the transferee plan does not provide some or all of the forms of distribution previously available under another defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the “transferor plan”) to the extent that—
                    (i)
                    the forms of distribution previously available under the transferor plan applied to the account of a participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan that was transferred from the transferor plan to the transferee plan pursuant to a direct transfer rather than pursuant to a distribution from the transferor plan;
                    (ii)
                    the terms of both the transferor plan and the transferee plan authorize the transfer described in clause (i);
                    (iii)
                    the transfer described in clause (i) was made pursuant to a voluntary election by the participant or beneficiary whose account was transferred to the transferee plan;
                    (iv)
                    the election described in clause (iii) was made after the participant or beneficiary received a notice describing the consequences of making the election; and
                    (v)
                    the transferee plan allows the participant or beneficiary described in clause (iii) to receive any distribution to which the participant or beneficiary is entitled under the transferee plan in the form of a single sum distribution.
                (B)
                Subparagraph (A) shall apply to plan mergers and other transactions having the effect of a direct transfer, including consolidations of benefits attributable to different employers within a multiple employer plan.
            (5)
            Except to the extent provided in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, a defined contribution plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because of the elimination of a form of distribution previously available thereunder. This paragraph shall not apply to the elimination of a form of distribution with respect to any participant unless—
                (A)
                a single sum payment is available to such participant at the same time or times as the form of distribution being eliminated; and
                (B)
                such single sum payment is based on the same or greater portion of the participant’s account as the form of distribution being eliminated.
    Notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals
        (h)
        Notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals
            (1)
            An applicable pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual (and to each employee organization representing applicable individuals) and to each employer who has an obligation to contribute to the plan.
            (2)
            The notice required by paragraph (1) shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and shall provide sufficient information (as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) to allow applicable individuals to understand the effect of the plan amendment. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide a simplified form of notice for, or exempt from any notice requirement, a plan—
                (A)
                which has fewer than 100 participants who have accrued a benefit under the plan, or
                (B)
                which offers participants the option to choose between the new benefit formula and the old benefit formula.
            (3)
            Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the notice required by paragraph (1) shall be provided within a reasonable time before the effective date of the plan amendment.
            (4)
            Any notice under paragraph (1) may be provided to a person designated, in writing, by the person to which it would otherwise be provided.
            (5)
            A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) merely because notice is provided before the adoption of the plan amendment if no material modification of the amendment occurs before the amendment is adopted.
            (6)
                (A)
                In the case of any egregious failure to meet any requirement of this subsection with respect to any plan amendment, the provisions of the applicable pension plan shall be applied as if such plan amendment entitled all applicable individuals to the greater of—
                    (i)

                under the plan, each participant—
                    (i)
                    may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit (or both),

                    the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse’s consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or
                (B)
                it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.

                        (II)
                        A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.
                        (III)
                        A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.
                        (IV)
                        A reasonable period ending after this section applies to the participant.

                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.

            In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.
            (8)
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection—
                (A)
                    (i)
                    A plan may provide the written explanation described in paragraph (3)(A) after the annuity starting date. In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the applicable election period under paragraph (7) shall not end before the 30th day after the date on which such explanation is provided.
                    (ii)
                    The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations limit the application of clause (i), except that such regulations may not limit the period of time by which the annuity starting date precedes the provision of the written explanation other than by providing that the annuity starting date may not be earlier than termination of employment.
                (B)
                A plan may permit a participant to elect (with any applicable spousal consent) to waive any requirement that the written explanation be provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date (or to waive the 30-day requirement under subparagraph (A)) if the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation is provided.

            No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant’s accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with
                section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title

                Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.

                (B)
                For purposes of this paragraph—
                    (i)
                    the term “qualified domestic relations order” means a domestic relations order—
                        (I)
                        which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee’s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and
                        (II)
                        with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and
                    (ii)
                    the term “domestic relations order” means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which—
                        (I)
                        relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and
                        (II)
                        is made pursuant to a State or Tribal domestic relations law (including a community property law).
                    For purposes of clause (ii)(II), the term “Tribal” with respect to a domestic relations law means such a law which is issued by or under the laws of an Indian tribal government (as defined in
                        section 7701(a)(40) of title 26
                (C)
                A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies—
                    (i)
                    the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,
                    (ii)
                    the amount or percentage of the participant’s benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,
                    (iii)
                    the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and
                    (iv)
                    each plan to which such order applies.
                (D)
                A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order—
                    (i)
                    does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,
                    (ii)
                    does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and
                    (iii)
                    does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
                (E)
                    (i)
                    A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee—
                        (I)
                        in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,
                        (II)
                        as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and
                        (III)
                        in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).
                    For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.
                    (ii)
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “earliest retirement age” means the earlier of—
                        (I)

                        (II)
                        the later of the date of
                            1
                                1
                (F)
                To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order—
                    (i)
                    the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of
                        section 1055 of this title
                    (ii)

                        section 1055(f) of this title
                (G)
                    (i)
                    In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan—
                        (I)
                        the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan’s procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and
                        (II)
                        within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.
                    (ii)
                    Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures—
                        (I)
                        shall be in writing,
                        (II)
                        shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and
                        (III)
                        shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.
                (H)
                    (i)
                    During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “segregated amounts”) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
                    (ii)
                    If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.
                    (iii)
                    If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)—
                        (I)
                        it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or
                        (II)
                        the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,
                    then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.
                    (iv)
                    Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.
                    (v)
                    For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.
                (I)
                If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in—
                    (i)
                    treating a domestic relations order as being (or not being) a qualified domestic relations order, or
                    (ii)
                    taking action under subparagraph (H),
                then the plan’s obligation to the participant and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such Act.

                    (iii)
                    the plan permitted commencement of benefits only on or after normal retirement age,

            In the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment by any pension plan, the responsible plan fiduciary shall not be considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of this subchapter merely because such fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such overpayment from—

                (C)
                any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary (including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has established prudent procedures to prevent and minimize overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries have followed such procedures, an inadvertent benefit overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.

            Recoupment from participants and beneficiaries
            If the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following conditions:
                (A)
                No interest or other additional amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for any period.
                (B)
                If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity by reducing future benefit payments—
                    (i)
                    the reduction ceases after the plan has recovered the full dollar amount of the overpayment,
                    (ii)
                    the amount recouped each calendar year does not exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the overpayment, and
                    (iii)
                    future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90 percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the terms of the plan.
                Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity through one or more installment payments, the sum of such installment payments in any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions that would be permitted in such year under the preceding sentence.
                (C)
                If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a benefit other than a non-decreasing annuity, the plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary of Labor for purposes of this subparagraph.
                (D)
                Efforts to recoup overpayments are—
                    (i)
                    not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless the responsible plan fiduciary makes a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood of success to recover an amount greater than the cost of recovery, and
                    (ii)
                    not made through a collection agency or similar third party, unless the participant or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement between the participant or beneficiary and the plan, in either case authorizing such recoupment.
                (E)
                Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant is not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, including a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other beneficiary.
                (F)
                Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpayment occurred more than 3 years before the participant or beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the participant.
                (G)
                A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment pursuant to the claims procedures of the plan that made the overpayment to the extent such procedures are consistent with
                    section 1133 of this title
                    section 402(c)(8)(B) of title 26
                    (i)
                    such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of such dispute,
                    (ii)
                    the plan receiving the rollover shall retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or beneficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpayment as plan assets) pending the outcome of such procedures, and
                    (iii)
                    the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted to be returned to such plan if it is determined to be an overpayment (and the plans making and receiving such transfer shall be treated as permitting such transfer).
                (H)
                In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship that recoupment likely would impose on the participant or beneficiary.
        Effect of culpability
            (5)
            Effect of culpability
                Subparagraphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount.

                    which consists of a defined benefit plan and an applicable individual account plan each of which qualifies under

                        An applicable individual account plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) because the employer makes nonelective contributions under the plan but such contributions shall not be taken into account in determining whether the requirements of clause (i)(II) are met.
            Vesting requirements
                (D)
                Vesting requirements

                    (ii)
                    in the case of an applicable individual account plan forming part of eligible combined plan—
                        (I)
                        an employee has a nonforfeitable right to any matching contribution made under the qualified cash or deferred arrangement included in such plan by an employer with respect to any elective contribution, including matching contributions in excess of the contributions required under subparagraph (C)(i)(II), and
                        (II)

                        receives a notice explaining the employee’s right under the arrangement to elect not to have elective contributions made on the employee’s behalf or to have the contributions made at a different rate, and

                        has a reasonable period of time after receipt of such notice and before the first elective contribution is made to make such election.

                    (ii)
                    application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate,
                the Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to subparagraph (C), waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard.

                        section 1084(b)(3)(C) of this title
                        section 1084(b)(2)(C) of this title

                the employer is operating at an economic loss,
                (B)
                there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,
                (C)
                the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and
                (D)

                (A)
                the funding shortfall of such plan for such plan year, minus
                (B)
                the present value (determined using the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2)) of the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments which have been determined for such plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases and waiver amortization bases of the plan for any plan year preceding such plan year.
        Funding shortfall
            (4)
            Funding shortfall
            For purposes of this section, the funding shortfall of a plan for any plan year is the excess (if any) of—
                (A)
                the funding target of the plan for the plan year, over
                (B)

            (5)
            Exemption from new shortfall amortization base
                In any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(A)) is equal to or greater than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the shortfall amortization base of the plan for such plan year shall be zero.
        Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
            (6)
            Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
                In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the shortfall amortization charge for such plan year and succeeding plan years, the shortfall amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all shortfall amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.

                    (i)
                    such increase shall not result in the amount of such installment exceeding the present value of such installment and all succeeding installments with respect to such base (determined without regard to such increase but after application of clause (ii)), and
                    (ii)
                    subsequent shortfall amortization installments with respect to such base shall, in reverse order of the otherwise required installments, be reduced to the extent necessary to limit the present value of such subsequent shortfall amortization installments (after application of this paragraph) to the present value of the remaining unamortized shortfall amortization base.

                        (I)
                        the sum of the shortfall amortization installments for the plan year and all preceding plan years in the amortization period elected under paragraph (2)(D) with respect to the shortfall amortization base with respect to an election year, determined without regard to paragraph (2)(D) and this paragraph, over

            Interest rate
                In determining any waiver amortization installment under this subsection, the plan sponsor shall use the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2).
        Waiver amortization base
            (4)
            Waiver amortization base
                The waiver amortization base of a plan for a plan year is the amount of the waived funding deficiency (if any) for such plan year under

        Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
            (5)
            Early deemed amortization upon attainment of funding target
                In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the waiver amortization charge for such plan year and succeeding plan years, the waiver amortization bases for all preceding plan years (and all waiver amortization installments determined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.

                Exception for small plans
                    If, on each day during the preceding plan year, a plan had 100 or fewer participants, the plan may designate any day during the plan year as its valuation date for such plan year and succeeding plan years. For purposes of this subparagraph, all defined benefit plans which are single-employer plans and are maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer’s controlled group) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only participants with respect to such employer or member shall be taken into account.
            Application of certain rules in determination of plan size

                In general
                    Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of plan assets shall be the fair market value of the assets.

                (B)
                Averaging allowed
                A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method—
                    (i)
                    is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
                    (ii)
                    does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and
                    (iii)
                    does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.
                Any such averaging shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings (as determined by the plan’s actuary on the basis of an assumed earnings rate specified by the actuary but not in excess of the third segment rate applicable under subsection (h)(2)(C)(iii)), as specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.
        Accounting for contribution receipts

                    (i)
                    an employer makes any contribution to the plan after the valuation date for the plan year in which the contribution is made, and
                    (ii)
                    the contribution is for a preceding plan year,
                the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such contribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.

                If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not include—
                    (i)
                    such contributions, and
                    (ii)

                    (ii)
                    in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable during the 15-year period beginning at the end of the period described in clause (i), the second segment rate with respect to the applicable month, and
                    (iii)
                    in the case of benefits reasonably determined to be payable after the period described in clause (ii), the third segment rate with respect to the applicable month.

                            If a segment rate described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) with respect to any applicable month (determined without regard to this clause) is less than the applicable minimum percentage, or more than the applicable maximum percentage, of the average of the segment rates described in such clause for years in the 25-year period ending with September 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the plan year begins, then the segment rate described in such clause with respect to the applicable month shall be equal to the applicable minimum percentage or the applicable maximum percentage of such average, whichever is closest. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine such average on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for years in any such 25-year period for which the rates described in any such clause are not available. Notwithstanding anything in this subclause, if the average of the first, second, or third segment rate for any 25-year period is less than 5 percent, such average shall be deemed to be 5 percent.

                    (ii)
                    Election to use yield curve
                        Solely for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution under this section, the plan sponsor may, in lieu of the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C), elect to use interest rates under the corporate bond yield curve. For purposes of the preceding sentence such curve shall be determined without regard to the 24-month averaging described in clause (i). Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury.

                        (II)
                        such table reflects the actual experience of the pension plans maintained by the sponsor and projected trends in general mortality experience.
                All plans in controlled group must use separate table
                    (iv)
                    All plans in controlled group must use separate table

                the probability that future benefit payments under the plan will be made in the form of optional forms of benefits provided under the plan (including lump sum distributions, determined on the basis of the plan’s experience and other related assumptions), and
                (B)
                any difference in the present value of such future benefit payments resulting from the use of actuarial assumptions, in determining benefit payments in any such optional form of benefits, which are different from those specified in this subsection.

                Additional actuarial assumptions
                The actuarial assumptions described in this subparagraph are as follows:
                    (i)
                    All employees who are not otherwise assumed to retire as of the valuation date but who will be eligible to elect benefits during the plan year and the 10 succeeding plan years shall be assumed to retire at the earliest retirement date under the plan but not before the end of the plan year for which the at-risk funding target and at-risk target normal cost are being determined.
                    (ii)
                    All employees shall be assumed to elect the retirement benefit available under the plan at the assumed retirement age (determined after application of clause (i)) which would result in the highest present value of benefits.

                Loading factor
                The loading factor applied with respect to a plan under this paragraph for any plan year is the sum of—
                    (i)
                    $700, times the number of participants in the plan, plus
                    (ii)

                (A)
                the excess of—
                    (i)

                        (I)
                        the present value of all benefits which are expected to accrue or to be earned under the plan during the plan year, determined using the additional actuarial assumptions described in paragraph (1)(B), plus
                        (II)
                        the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year, over
                    (ii)
                    the amount of mandatory employee contributions expected to be made during the plan year, plus
                (B)
                in the case of a plan which also has been in at-risk status for at least 2 of the 4 preceding plan years, a loading factor equal to 4 percent of the amount determined under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) with respect to the plan for the plan year.

                (D)
                in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard under

            Special rule for amounts first amortized in plan years before 2008
                In the case of any amount amortized under
                    section 1082(b) of this title
                    August 17, 2006

            (5)
            Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized
            Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be—
                (A)
                may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and
                (B)
                may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.

            (6)
            Interest
                The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.

                    Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer’s withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan’s funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.
            Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization

                    (i)
                    shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but
                    (ii)
                    shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.
                The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 1423(a)

                        August 17, 2006
            Financial assistance
                (F)

                Short-term benefits
                    To the extent that any plan amendment increases the unfunded past service liability under the plan by reason of an increase in benefits which are not payable as a life annuity but are payable under the terms of the plan for a period that does not exceed 14 years from the effective date of the amendment, paragraph (2)(B)(ii) shall be applied separately with respect to such increase in unfunded past service liability by substituting the number of years of the period during which such benefits are payable for “15”.

                        (II)
                        if an extension was granted under subsection (d) for any plan year before the election to have this subparagraph apply to the plan year, such extension shall not result in such amortization period exceeding 30 years.
                Net investment losses
                    (iii)
                    Net investment losses
                    For purposes of this subparagraph—

                        (I)
                        In general
                            Net investment losses shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the difference between actual and expected returns (including any difference attributable to any criminally fraudulent investment arrangement).

                    In general
                    A multiemployer plan with respect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may change its asset valuation method in a manner which—
                        (I)
                        spreads the difference between expected and actual returns for either or both of the first 2 plan years ending after
                            August 31, 2008
                        (II)

                    If this subparagraph applies for any plan year—
                        (I)
                        the Secretary of the Treasury shall not treat the asset valuation method of the plan as unreasonable solely because of the changes in such method described in clause (i), and
                        (II)
                        such changes shall be deemed approved by such Secretary under
                            section 1082(d)(1) of this title

                        If this subparagraph and subparagraph (A) both apply for any plan year, the plan shall treat any reduction in unfunded accrued liability resulting from the application of this subparagraph as a separate experience amortization base, to be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 30 plan years rather than the period such liability would otherwise be amortized over.

                (C)
                Solvency test
                    The solvency test under this paragraph is met only if the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period, taking into account the changes in the funding standard account under this paragraph.

                (D)
                Restriction on benefit increases

                    (i)
                    the plan actuary certifies that—
                        (I)
                        any such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not allocated to the plan immediately before the application of this paragraph to the plan, and
                        (II)
                        the plan’s funded percentage and projected credit balances for such 2 plan years are reasonably expected to be at least as high as such percentage and balances would have been if the benefit increase had not been adopted, or
                    (ii)
                    the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.

                        an event which is reasonably and reliably predictable (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury),

                        The Secretary of the Treasury shall periodically (at least every 5 years) review any tables in effect under this subparagraph and shall, to the extent such Secretary determines necessary, by regulation update the tables to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.

                (E)
                Required change of interest rate

                    In general
                        If any rate of interest used under the plan under subsection (b)(6) to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.

                    (ii)
                    Permissible range

                    If the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan submits to the Secretary of the Treasury an application for an extension of the period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) or described in subsection (b)(4), the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the amortization period for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years reduced by the number of years of any extension under paragraph (1) with respect to such unfunded liability) if the Secretary of the Treasury makes the determination described in subparagraph (B). Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (1).

                    (ii)
                    the failure to permit such extension would—
                        (I)

                        (II)
                        the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current plan year and each of the 6 succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of all collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years,
                is less than the present value of all nonforfeitable benefits projected to be payable under the plan during the current plan year and each of the 6 succeeding plan years (plus administrative expenses for such plan years).

                        (II)
                        the present value of the reasonably anticipated employer and employee contributions for the current plan year,

                (B)
                Actuarial projections of assets and liabilities
                In general
                    (i)
                    In general
                    Except as provided in clause (iv), in making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projections required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary’s projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either—
                        (I)
                        the actuarial statement required under
                            section 1023(d) of this title
                        (II)
                        the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.

                    Determinations of future contributions
                    Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume—
                        (I)
                        reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or
                        (II)
                        that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.
                Projected industry activity
                    (iii)
                    Projected industry activity
                        Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.

                    (iv)
                        2
                    In determining whether a plan is in critical and declining status as described in subsection (e)(9), clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall apply, except that—
                        (I)
                        if reasonable, the plan actuary shall assume that each contributing employer in compliance continues to comply through the end of the rehabilitation period or such later time as provided in subsection (e)(3)(A)(ii) with the terms of the rehabilitation plan that correspond to the schedule adopted or imposed under subsection (e), and
                        (II)
                        the plan actuary shall take into account any suspensions of benefits described in subsection (e)(9) adopted in a prior plan year that are still in effect.

                    (ii)
                    The plan sponsor determines, in a written record to be maintained throughout the period of the benefit suspension, that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended under this paragraph, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension). In its determination, the plan sponsor may take into account factors including the following:

                        (VI)
                        Compensation levels of active participants relative to employees in the participants’ industry generally.

                In any case in which a qualified change in investment options occurs in connection with an individual account plan, a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated for purposes of paragraph (1) as not exercising control over the assets in his account in connection with such change if the requirements of subparagraph (C) are met in connection with such change.

                    the account of the participant or beneficiary is reallocated among one or more remaining or new investment options which are offered in lieu of one or more investment options offered immediately prior to the effective date of the change, and
                    (ii)
                    the stated characteristics of the remaining or new investment options provided under clause (i), including characteristics relating to risk and rate of return, are, as of immediately after the change, reasonably similar to those of the existing investment options as of immediately before the change.

                    (ii)
                    the participant or beneficiary has not provided to the plan administrator, in advance of the effective date of the change, affirmative investment instructions contrary to the change, and

                    the investments under the plan of the participant or beneficiary as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the change were the product of the exercise by such participant or beneficiary of control over the assets of the account within the meaning of paragraph (1).
            (5)
                Default investment arrangements.—
                (A)
                    In general
                For purposes of paragraph (1), a participant or beneficiary in an individual account plan meeting the notice requirements of subparagraph (B) shall be treated as exercising control over the assets in the account with respect to the amount of contributions and earnings which, in the absence of an investment election by the participant or beneficiary, are invested by the plan in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The regulations under this subparagraph shall provide guidance on the appropriateness of designating default investments that include a mix of asset classes consistent with capital preservation or long-term capital appreciation, or a blend of both.

                        has a reasonable period of time after receipt of such notice and before the beginning of the plan year to make such designation.

        (e)
        Safe harbor for annuity selection
        In general
            (1)
            In general
            With respect to the selection of an insurer for a guaranteed retirement income contract, the requirements of subsection (a)(1)(B) will be deemed to be satisfied if a fiduciary—
                (A)
                engages in an objective, thorough, and analytical search for the purpose of identifying insurers from which to purchase such contracts;
                (B)
                with respect to each insurer identified under subparagraph (A)—
                    (i)
                    considers the financial capability of such insurer to satisfy its obligations under the guaranteed retirement income contract; and
                    (ii)
                    considers the cost (including fees and commissions) of the guaranteed retirement income contract offered by the insurer in relation to the benefits and product features of the contract and administrative services to be provided under such contract; and
                (C)
                on the basis of such consideration, concludes that—
                    (i)
                    at the time of the selection, the insurer is financially capable of satisfying its obligations under the guaranteed retirement income contract; and
                    (ii)
                    the relative cost of the selected guaranteed retirement income contract as described in subparagraph (B)(ii) is reasonable.
        Financial capability of the insurer
            (2)
            Financial capability of the insurer
            A fiduciary will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (1)(B)(i) and (1)(C)(i) if—
                (A)
                the fiduciary obtains written representations from the insurer that—
                    (i)
                    the insurer is licensed to offer guaranteed retirement income contracts;
                    (ii)
                    the insurer, at the time of selection and for each of the immediately preceding 7 plan years—
                        (I)
                        operates under a certificate of authority from the insurance commissioner of its domiciliary State which has not been revoked or suspended;
                        (II)
                        has filed audited financial statements in accordance with the laws of its domiciliary State under applicable statutory accounting principles;
                        (III)
                        maintains (and has maintained) reserves which satisfies all the statutory requirements of all States where the insurer does business; and
                        (IV)
                        is not operating under an order of supervision, rehabilitation, or liquidation;
                    (iii)
                    the insurer undergoes, at least every 5 years, a financial examination (within the meaning of the law of its domiciliary State) by the insurance commissioner of the domiciliary State (or representative, designee, or other party approved by such commissioner); and
                    (iv)
                    the insurer will notify the fiduciary of any change in circumstances occurring after the provision of the representations in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) which would preclude the insurer from making such representations at the time of issuance of the guaranteed retirement income contract; and
                (B)
                after receiving such representations and as of the time of selection, the fiduciary has not received any notice described in subparagraph (A)(iv) and is in possession of no other information which would cause the fiduciary to question the representations provided.
        No requirement to select lowest cost
            (3)
            No requirement to select lowest cost
                Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a fiduciary to select the lowest cost contract. A fiduciary may consider the value of a contract, including features and benefits of the contract and attributes of the insurer (including, without limitation, the insurer’s financial strength) in conjunction with the cost of the contract.

            (4)

§ 1112. Bonding
    Requisite bonding of plan officials
        (a)
        Requisite bonding of plan officials
        Every fiduciary of an employee benefit plan and every person who handles funds or other property of such a plan (hereafter in this section referred to as “plan official”) shall be bonded as provided in this section; except that—
            (1)
            where such plan is one under which the only assets from which benefits are paid are the general assets of a union or of an employer, the administrator, officers, and employees of such plan shall be exempt from the bonding requirements of this section,
            (2)
            no bond shall be required of any entity which is registered as a broker or a dealer under section 78
                o

                    1
            (3)
            no bond shall be required of a fiduciary (or of any director, officer, or employee of such fiduciary) if such fiduciary—
                (A)
                is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State;
                (B)
                is authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers or to conduct an insurance business;
                (C)
                is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority; and
                (D)
                has at all times a combined capital and surplus in excess of such a minimum amount as may be established by regulations issued by the Secretary, which amount shall be at least $1,000,000. Paragraph (2) shall apply to a bank or other financial institution which is authorized to exercise trust powers and the deposits of which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, only if such bank or institution meets bonding or similar requirements under State law which the Secretary determines are at least equivalent to those imposed on banks by Federal law.
            The amount of such bond shall be fixed at the beginning of each fiscal year of the plan. Such amount shall be not less than 10 per centum of the amount of funds handled. In no case shall such bond be less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the Secretary, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to all interested parties, and after consideration of the record, may prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000, subject to the 10 per centum limitation of the preceding sentence. For purposes of fixing the amount of such bond, the amount of funds handled shall be determined by the funds handled by the person, group, or class to be covered by such bond and by their predecessor or predecessors, if any, during the preceding reporting year, or if the plan has no preceding reporting year, the amount of funds to be handled during the current reporting year by such person, group, or class, estimated as provided in regulations of the Secretary. Such bond shall provide protection to the plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the plan official, directly or through connivance with others. Any bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to sections 9304–9308 of title 31. Any bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary, including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class. In the case of a plan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of
                section 1107(d)(1) of this title

    Unlawful acts
        (b)
        Unlawful acts
            It shall be unlawful for any plan official to whom subsection (a) applies, to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of any of the funds or other property of any employee benefit plan, without being bonded as required by subsection (a) and it shall be unlawful for any plan official of such plan, or any other person having authority to direct the performance of such functions, to permit such functions, or any of them, to be performed by any plan official, with respect to whom the requirements of subsection (a) have not been met.

        (c)
        Conflict of interest prohibited in procuring bonds
            It shall be unlawful for any person to procure any bond required by subsection (a) from any surety or other company or through any agent or broker in whose business operations such plan or any party in interest in such plan has any control or significant financial interest, direct or indirect.
    Exclusiveness of statutory basis for bonding requirement for persons handling funds or other property of employee benefit plans
        (d)
        Exclusiveness of statutory basis for bonding requirement for persons handling funds or other property of employee benefit plans
            Nothing in any other provision of law shall require any person, required to be bonded as provided in subsection (a) because he handles funds or other property of an employee benefit plan, to be bonded insofar as the handling by such person of the funds or other property of such plan is concerned.
    Regulations
        (e)
        Regulations
            The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section including exempting a plan from the requirements of this section where he finds that (1) other bonding arrangements or (2) the overall financial condition of the plan would be adequate to protect the interests of the beneficiaries and participants. When, in the opinion of the Secretary, the administrator of a plan offers adequate evidence of the financial responsibility of the plan, or that other bonding arrangements would provide adequate protection of the beneficiaries and participants, he may exempt such plan from the requirements of this section.

                (C)
                in a manner so that, if such services are provided to a participant or beneficiary by a nonparticipating provider or a nonparticipating emergency facility—
                    (i)
                    such services will be provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage that is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency services received from participating providers and participating emergency facilities with respect to such plan or coverage, respectively;
                    (ii)
                    the cost-sharing requirement is not greater than the requirement that would apply if such services were provided by a participating provider or a participating emergency facility;
                    (iii)

                        pays a total plan or coverage payment directly to such provider or facility, respectively (in accordance, if applicable, with the timing requirement described in subsection (c)(6)) that is, with application of any initial payment under subclause (I), equal to the amount by which the out-of-network rate (as defined in paragraph (3)(K)) for such services exceeds the cost-sharing amount for such services (as determined in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii)) and year; and
                    (v)
                    any cost-sharing payments made by the participant or beneficiary with respect to such emergency services so furnished shall be counted toward any in-network deductible or out-of-pocket maximums applied under the plan or coverage, respectively (and such in-network deductible and out-of-pocket maximums shall be applied) in the same manner as if such cost-sharing payments were made with respect to emergency services furnished by a participating provider or a participating emergency facility; and
                (D)
                without regard to any other term or condition of such coverage (other than exclusion or coordination of benefits, or an affiliation or waiting period, permitted under

            Such rulemaking shall take into account payments that are made by such plan or issuer, respectively, that are not on a fee-for-service basis. Such methodology may account for relevant payment adjustments that take into account quality or facility type (including higher acuity settings and the case-mix of various facility types) that are otherwise taken into account for purposes of determining payment amounts with respect to participating facilities. In carrying out clause (iii), the Secretary shall consult with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to establish the geographic regions under such clause and shall periodically update such regions, as appropriate, taking into account the findings of the report submitted under section 109(a) of the No Surprises Act.

                (C)
                If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution of disapproval.

A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.
            (6)
                (A)
                Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee or the consideration of a resolution of disapproval, and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business, shall be decided without debate.

            (7)

            (9)
            This subsection is enacted by the Congress—
                (A)
                as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions of disapproval described in paragraph (2); and they supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and
                (B)
                with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedures of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.

They shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.

The motion to discharge may be made only by a person favoring the resolution, shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same proposed rate), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to.

                        refrains from distributing assets or taking any other actions to carry out the proposed termination under this subsection,

            (2)

The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation’s risk of loss with respect to the plan.
            (2)
            The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.
§ 1342. Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation
    Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan
        (a)
        Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan
        The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that—
            (1)
            the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under
                section 412 of title 26
                section 6212 of title 26
                section 4971(a) of title 26

            (4)
            the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.
        The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c)). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.
    Appointment of trustee
        (b)
        Appointment of trustee
            (1)
            Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.
            (2)
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter—
                (A)
                upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and
                (B)
                upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which
                    section 1341a(d) of this title
            (3)
            The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).
    Adjudication that plan must be terminated
        (c)
        Adjudication that plan must be terminated
            (1)
            If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3). Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.
            (2)
            In the case of a proceeding initiated under this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, upon the request of the corporation, the information described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of
                section 1341(c)(2)(A) of this title
            (3)

            (1)
            First, to that portion of each individual’s accrued benefit which is derived from the participant’s contributions to the plan which were not mandatory contributions.
            (2)
            Second, to that portion of each individual’s accrued benefit which is derived from the participant’s mandatory contributions.
            (3)
            Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity—
                (A)
                in the case of the benefit of a participant or beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least,
                (B)
                in the case of a participant’s or beneficiary’s benefit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least.
            For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.
            (4)
            Fourth—
                (A)
                to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the plan guaranteed under this subchapter (determined without regard to
                    section 1322b(a) of this title
                (B)
                to the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subparagraph (A) if
                    section 1322(b)(5)(B) of this title

        (b)

        For purposes of subsection (a)—
            (1)
            The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection (a) with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a).
            (2)
            If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection (a) (other than paragraphs (4), (5), and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.
            (3)
            If assets available for allocation under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals who are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated first to benefits described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph. Any remaining assets shall then be allocated to benefits described in subparagraph (B) of that paragraph. If assets allocated to such subparagraph (B) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in that subparagraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that subparagraph.
            (4)
            This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.
                (A)
                If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.
                (B)
                If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.
            (5)
            If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by
                section 401(a)(4) of title 26
            (6)
            The term “mandatory contributions” means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.
            (7)
            A plan may establish subclasses and categories within the classes described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
    Increase or decrease in value of assets
        (c)
        Increase or decrease in value of assets
            Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under
                section 1342(b) of this title

            (1)
            Subject to paragraph (3), any residual assets of a single-employer plan may be distributed to the employer if—
                (A)
                all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,
                (B)
                the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and
                (C)
                the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.
            (2)
                (A)
                In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.
                (B)
                A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.
                (C)
                Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in
                    section 1058 of this title

                Before any distribution from a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), if any assets of the plan attributable to employee contributions remain after satisfaction of all liabilities described in subsection (a), such remaining assets shall be equitably distributed to the participants who made such contributions or their beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of
                    section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title
                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the remaining assets which are attributable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying—
                    (i)
                    the market value of the total remaining assets, by
                    (ii)

                (D)
                Dispositions
                If, whether by reason of a sale or other disposition of the assets or stock of a contributing sponsor (or any member of the same controlled group as such a sponsor) of the plan relating to operations at a facility or otherwise, an employer (the “transferee employer”) other than the employer which experiences the substantial cessation of operations (the “transferor employer”) conducts any portion of such operations, then—
                    (i)
                    an eligible employee separated from employment with the transferor employer at the facility shall not be taken into account in computing a workforce reduction if—

                        in the case of an eligible employee who is a participant in a single employer plan maintained by the transferor employer, the transferee employer, within a reasonable period of time, maintains a single employer plan which includes the assets and liabilities attributable to the accrued benefit of the eligible employee at the time of separation from employment with the transferor employer; and
                    (ii)
                    an eligible employee who continues to be employed at the facility by the transferee employer shall not be taken into account in computing a workforce reduction if—
                        (I)
                        the eligible employee is not a participant in a single employer plan maintained by the transferor employer, or
                        (II)
                        in any other case, the transferee employer, within a reasonable period of time, maintains a single employer plan which includes the assets and liabilities attributable to the accrued benefit of the eligible employee at the time of separation from employment with the transferor employer.

            (1)
            require the plan fund to be equitably allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;
            (2)

                section 1342 of this title
            (3)

                    is amended to provide that this subsection applies to employers described in this paragraph.
            (2)
            A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if—
                (A)
                an employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, and
                (B)
                the employer—
                    (i)
                    continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required, or
                    (ii)
                    resumes such work within 5 years after the date on which the obligation to contribute under the plan ceases, and does not renew the obligation at the time of the resumption.
            (3)
            In the case of a plan terminated by mass withdrawal (within the meaning of
                section 1341a(a)(2) of this title
    Entertainment industry
        (c)
        Entertainment industry
            (1)
            Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the entertainment industry, primarily on a temporary or project-by-project basis, if the plan primarily covers employees in the entertainment industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in subsection (b)(2) applied by substituting “plan” for “collective bargaining agreement” in subparagraph (B)(i) thereof.
            (2)
            For purposes of this subsection, the term “entertainment industry” means—
                (A)
                theater, motion picture (except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation), radio, television, sound or visual recording, music, and dance, and
                (B)
                such other entertainment activities as the corporation may determine to be appropriate.
            (3)
            The corporation may by regulation exclude a group or class of employers described in the preceding sentence from the application of this subsection if the corporation determines that such exclusion is necessary—
                (A)
                to protect the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries, or
                (B)
                to prevent a significant risk of loss to the corporation with respect to the plan.
            (4)
            A plan may be amended to provide that this subsection shall not apply to a group or class of employers under the plan.
    Other determinative factors
        (d)
        Other determinative factors
            (1)
            Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of an employer who—
                (A)
                has an obligation to contribute under a plan described in paragraph (2) primarily for work described in such paragraph, and
                (B)
                does not continue to perform work within the jurisdiction of the plan,
            a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (3).
            (2)
            A plan is described in this paragraph if substantially all of the contributions required under the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing industry.
            (3)
            A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if—
                (A)
                an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and
                (B)
                either—
                    (i)
                    the corporation determines that the plan has suffered substantial damage to its contribution base as a result of such cessation, or
                    (ii)
                    the employer fails to furnish a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of
                        section 1112 of this title
            (4)
            If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the cessation of the employer’s obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in substantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan. The corporation shall not make a determination under this paragraph more than 60 months after the date on which such obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased.
            (5)
            If the corporation determines that the employer has no further liability under the plan either—
                (A)
                because it determines that the contribution base of the plan has not suffered substantial damage as a result of the cessation of the employer’s obligation to contribute or cessation of covered operations (considered together with any cessation of contribution obligation, or of covered operations, with respect to other employers), or
                (B)
                because it may not make a determination under paragraph (4) because of the last sentence thereof,
            then the bond shall be cancelled or the escrow refunded.
            (6)
            Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the amount of the withdrawal liability of any employer.
    Date of complete withdrawal
        (e)
        Date of complete withdrawal
            For purposes of this part, the date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.

        Special liability withdrawal rules for industries other than construction and entertainment industries; procedures applicable to amend plans
            (1)
            The corporation may prescribe regulations under which plans in industries other than the construction or entertainment industries may be amended to provide for special withdrawal liability rules similar to the rules described in subsections (b) and (c).
            (2)
            Regulations under paragraph (1) shall permit use of special withdrawal liability rules—
                (A)
                only in industries (or portions thereof) in which, as determined by the corporation, the characteristics that would make use of such rules appropriate are clearly shown, and
                (B)
                only if the corporation determines, in each instance in which special withdrawal liability rules are permitted, that use of such rules will not pose a significant risk to the corporation under this subchapter.
§ 1384. Sale of assets
    Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller
        (a)
        Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller
            (1)
            A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “seller”) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm’s-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “purchaser”), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if—
                (A)
                the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;
                (B)
                the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of
                    section 1112 of this title
                    (i)
                    the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer’s assets occurs, or
                    (ii)
                    the annual contribution that the seller was required to make with respect to the operations under the plan for the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the assets occurs,
                which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and
                (C)
                the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.
            (2)
            If the purchaser—
                (A)
                withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and
                (B)
                fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,
            then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.
            (3)
                (A)
                If all, or substantially all, of the seller’s assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.
                (B)
                If only a portion of the seller’s assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).
            (4)
            The liability of the party furnishing a bond or escrow under this subsection shall be reduced, upon payment of the bond or escrow to the plan, by the amount thereof.
    Liability of purchaser
        (b)
        Liability of purchaser
            (1)
            For the purposes of this part, the liability of the purchaser shall be determined as if the purchaser had been required to contribute to the plan in the year of the sale and the 4 plan years preceding the sale the amount the seller was required to contribute for such operations for such 5 plan years.
            (2)
            If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B).
    Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable
        (c)
        Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable
        The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation—
            (1)
            shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the variance or exemption,
            (2)
            shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and
            (3)
            shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present their views.
    “Unrelated party” defined
        (d)
        “Unrelated party” defined
            For purposes of this section, the term “unrelated party” means a purchaser or seller who does not bear a relationship to the seller or purchaser, as the case may be, that is described in
                section 267(b) of title 26
§ 1385. Partial withdrawals
    Determinative factors
        (a)
        Determinative factors
        Except as otherwise provided in this section, there is a partial withdrawal by an employer from a plan on the last day of a plan year if for such plan year—
            (1)
            there is a 70-percent contribution decline, or
            (2)
            there is a partial cessation of the employer’s contribution obligation.
    Criteria applicable
        (b)
        Criteria applicable
        For purposes of subsection (a)—
            (1)
                (A)
                There is a 70-percent contribution decline for any plan year if during each plan year in the 3-year testing period the employer’s contribution base units do not exceed 30 percent of the employer’s contribution base units for the high base year.
                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
                    (i)
                    The term “3-year testing period” means the period consisting of the plan year and the immediately preceding 2 plan years.
                    (ii)
                    The number of contribution base units for the high base year is the average number of such units for the 2 plan years for which the employer’s contribution base units were the highest within the 5 plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period.
            (2)
                (A)
                There is a partial cessation of the employer’s contribution obligation for the plan year if, during such year—
                    (i)
                    the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required or transfers such work to another location or to an entity or entities owned or controlled by the employer, or
                    (ii)
                    an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan with respect to work performed at one or more but fewer than all of its facilities, but continues to perform work at the facility of the type for which the obligation to contribute ceased.
                (B)
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.
    Retail food industry
        (c)
        Retail food industry
            (1)
            In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with respect to such plan—
                (A)
                by substituting “35 percent” for “70 percent” in subsections (a) and (b), and
                (B)
                by substituting “65 percent” for “30 percent” in subsection (b).
            (2)
            Any amendment adopted under paragraph (1) shall provide rules for the equitable reduction of withdrawal liability in any case in which the number of the plan’s contribution base units, in the 2 plan years following the plan year of withdrawal of the employer, is higher than such number immediately after the withdrawal.
            (3)

§ 1386. Adjustment for partial withdrawal; determination of amount; reduction for partial withdrawal liability; procedures applicable
        (a)
        The amount of an employer’s liability for a partial withdrawal, before the application of sections 1399(c)(1) and 1405 of this title, is equal to the product of—
            (1)
            the amount determined under
                section 1391 of this title
                section 1389 of this title
                (A)
                on the date of the partial withdrawal, or
                (B)
                in the case of a partial withdrawal described in
                    section 1385(a)(1) of this title
            multiplied by
            (2)
            a fraction which is 1 minus a fraction—
                (A)
                the numerator of which is the employer’s contribution base units for the plan year following the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, and
                (B)
                the denominator of which is the average of the employer’s contribution base units for—
                    (i)
                    except as provided in clause (ii), the 5 plan years immediately preceding the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, or
                    (ii)
                    in the case of a partial withdrawal described in
                        section 1385(a)(1) of this title
        (b)
            (1)
            In the case of an employer that has withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a plan, any withdrawal liability of that employer for a partial or complete withdrawal from that plan in a subsequent plan year shall be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal liability (reduced by any abatement or reduction of such liability) of the employer with respect to the plan for a previous plan year.
            (2)
            The corporation shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to provide for proper adjustments in the reduction provided by paragraph (1) for—
                (A)
                changes in unfunded vested benefits arising after the close of the prior year for which partial withdrawal liability was determined,
                (B)
                changes in contribution base units occurring after the close of the prior year for which partial withdrawal liability was determined, and
                (C)
                any other factors for which it determines adjustment to be appropriate,
            so that the liability for any complete or partial withdrawal in any subsequent year (after the application of the reduction) properly reflects the employer’s share of liability with respect to the plan.
§ 1387. Reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability; procedures and standards applicable
        (a)
        The corporation shall provide by regulation for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete withdrawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent that the corporation determines that reduction or waiver of withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
        (b)
        The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete withdrawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from the plan subsequently resumes covered operations or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan. The rules may apply only to the extent that the rules are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
§ 1388. Reduction of partial withdrawal liability

                (B)
                If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer has no further liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then the bond shall be cancelled.
                (C)
                If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer continues to have liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then—
                    (i)
                    the bond shall be paid to the plan,
                    (ii)

                    (iii)
                    the employer shall continue to make the partial withdrawal liability payments as they are due.

        If—
            (1)
            for any 2 consecutive plan years following a partial withdrawal under
                section 1385(a)(1) of this title
                section 1385(b)(1)(B)(ii) of this title

                    1
            (2)
            the total number of contribution base units with respect to which all employers under the plan have obligations to contribute in each of such 2 consecutive years is not less than 90 percent of the total number of contribution base units for which all employers had obligations to contribute in the partial withdrawal plan year;
        then, the employer shall have no obligation to make payments with respect to such partial withdrawal (other than delinquent payments) for plan years beginning after the second such consecutive plan year.

        Reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions; criteria; procedures applicable
            (1)
            The corporation may prescribe regulations providing for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions with respect to which the corporation determines that reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
            (2)
            Under such regulations, reduction of withdrawal liability shall be provided only with respect to subsequent changes in the employer’s contributions for the same operations, or under the same collective bargaining agreement, that gave rise to the partial withdrawal, and changes in the employer’s contribution base units with respect to other facilities or other collective bargaining agreements shall not be taken into account.
            (3)
            The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may by amendment adopt rules for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any other conditions, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of such rules by the plan is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

            ¾ of 1 percent of the plan’s unfunded vested obligations (determined as of the end of the plan year ending before the date of withdrawal), or
            (2)
            $50,000,
        reduced by the amount, if any, by which the unfunded vested benefits allowable to the employer, determined without regard to this subsection, exceeds $100,000.
    Amendment of plan for reduction of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
        (b)
        Amendment of plan for reduction of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
        A plan may be amended to provide for the reduction of the amount determined under
            section 1391 of this title
            (1)
            the amount determined under subsection (a), or

        Nonapplicability
        This section does not apply—
            (1)
            to an employer who withdraws in a plan year in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan, or
            (2)
            in any case in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan during a period of one or more plan years pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw, to an employer who withdraws pursuant to such agreement or arrangement.
    Presumption of employer withdrawal from plan pursuant to agreement or arrangement applicable in action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability
        (d)
        Presumption of employer withdrawal from plan pursuant to agreement or arrangement applicable in action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability
            In any action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability, if substantially all employers have withdrawn from a plan within a period of 3 plan years, an employer who has withdrawn from such plan during such period shall be presumed to have withdrawn from the plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
§ 1390. Nonapplicability of withdrawal liability for certain temporary contribution obligation periods; exception
        (a)
        An employer who withdraws from a plan in complete or partial withdrawal is not liable to the plan if the employer—
            (1)
            first had an obligation to contribute to the plan after
                September 26, 1980
            (2)
            had an obligation to contribute to the plan for no more than the lesser of—
                (A)
                6 consecutive plan years preceding the date on which the employer withdraws, or
                (B)
                the number of years required for vesting under the plan,
            (3)
            was required to make contributions to the plan for each such plan year in an amount equal to less than 2 percent of the sum of all employer contributions made to the plan for each such year, and
            (4)
            has never avoided withdrawal liability because of the application of this section with respect to the plan.
        (b)
        Subsection (a) shall apply to an employer with respect to a plan only if—
            (1)
            the plan is amended to provide that subsection (a) applies;
            (2)
            the plan provides, or is amended to provide, that the reduction under
                section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26
            (3)
            the ratio of the assets of the plan for the plan year preceding the first plan year for which the employer was required to contribute to the plan to the benefit payments made during that plan year was at least 8 to 1.
§ 1391. Methods for computing withdrawal liability
    Determination of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
        (a)
        Determination of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
            The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a plan shall be determined in accordance with subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
    Factors determining computation of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
        (b)
        Factors determining computation of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
            (1)
            Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws is the sum of—
                (A)
                the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after
                    September 25, 1980
                (B)
                the employer’s proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year ending before
                    September 26, 1980
                (C)
                the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amounts of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (if any) as determined under paragraph (4).
            If the sum of the amounts determined with respect to an employer under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) is negative, the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer shall be zero.
            (2)
                (A)
                An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after
                    September 25, 1980
                    (i)
                    after such date, and
                    (ii)
                    before the plan year in which the withdrawal of the employer occurs.
                (B)
                The change in a plan’s unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the amount by which—
                    (i)
                    the unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year; exceeds
                    (ii)
                    the sum of—
                        (I)
                        the unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before
                            September 26, 1980
                        (II)
                        the sum of the unamortized amounts of the change in unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending after
                            September 25, 1980
                (C)
                The unamortized amount of the change in a plan’s unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the change in unfunded vested benefits for the plan year, reduced by 5 percent of such change for each succeeding plan year.
                (D)
                The unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before
                    September 26, 1980
                (E)
                An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of a change in unfunded vested benefits is the product of—
                    (i)
                    the unamortized amount of such change (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by
                    (ii)
                    a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the sum of the contributions required to be made under the plan by the employer for the year in which such change arose and for the 4 preceding plan years, and
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the sum for the plan year in which such change arose and the 4 preceding plan years of all contributions made by employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the plan year in which such change arose reduced by the contributions made in such years by employers who had withdrawn from the plan in the year in which the change arose.
            (3)
            An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before
                September 26, 1980
                (A)
                such unamortized amount; multiplied by—
                (B)
                a fraction—
                    (i)
                    the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the most recent 5 plan years ending before
                        September 26, 1980
                    (ii)
                    the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the most recent 5 plan years ending before
                        September 26, 1980
                        (I)
                        who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending on or after such date, and
                        (II)
                        who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.
            (4)
                (A)
                An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending before the plan year in which the employer withdrew from the plan.
                (B)
                Except as otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the sum of—
                    (i)
                    any amount which the plan sponsor determines in that plan year to be uncollectible for reasons arising out of cases or proceedings under title 11, or similar proceedings.
                        1
                            1
                    (ii)
                    any amount which the plan sponsor determines in that plan year will not be assessed as a result of the operation of section 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), or 1405 of this title against an employer to whom a notice described in
                        section 1399 of this title
                    (iii)
                    any amount which the plan sponsor determines to be uncollectible or unassessable in that plan year for other reasons under standards not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
                (C)
                The unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for the plan year, reduced by 5 percent of such reallocated unfunded vested benefits for each succeeding plan year.
                (D)
                An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the product of—
                    (i)
                    the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by
                    (ii)
                    the fraction defined in paragraph (2)(E)(ii).
    Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount
        (c)
        Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount
            (1)
            A multiemployer plan, other than a plan which primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, may be amended to provide that the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from the plan is an amount determined under paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, rather than under subsection (b) or (d). A plan described in
                section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title
                section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title
            (2)
                (A)
                The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).
                (B)
                The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of—
                    (i)
                    the plan’s unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before
                        September 26, 1980
                    (ii)
                    a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before
                            September 26, 1980
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the last 5 plan years ending before
                            September 26, 1980
                            September 25, 1980
                (C)
                The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of—
                    (i)
                    an amount equal to—
                        (I)
                        the plan’s unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less
                        (II)
                        the sum of the value as of such date of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected, with respect to employers withdrawing before such plan year, and that portion of the amount determined under subparagraph (B)(i) which is allocable to employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and who also had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after
                            September 25, 1980
                    (ii)
                    a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan by the employer for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, and
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer who withdrew from the plan under this part during those plan years.
                (D)
                The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.
            (3)
            The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is the product of—
                (A)
                the plan’s unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers withdrawing before such year; multiplied by
                (B)
                a fraction—
                    (i)
                    the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, and
                    (ii)
                    the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed to the plan during those plan years by employers who withdrew from the plan under this section during those plan years.
            (4)
                (A)
                The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is equal to the sum of—
                    (i)
                    the plan’s unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants’ service with the employer (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws), and
                    (ii)
                    the employer’s proportional share of any unfunded vested benefits which are not attributable to service with the employer or other employers who are obligated to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws).
                (B)
                The plan’s unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants’ service with the employer is the amount equal to the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan which are attributable to participants’ service with such employer (determined under plan rules not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation) decreased by the share of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) which is allocated to the employer as provided under subparagraph (D).
                (C)
                The value of plan assets determined under this subparagraph is the value of plan assets allocated to nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, which is determined by multiplying—
                    (i)
                    the value of the plan assets as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, by
                    (ii)
                    a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the value of nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with such employers, and
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the value of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan
                    as of the end of the plan year.
                (D)
                The share of plan assets, determined under subparagraph (C), which is allocated to the employer shall be determined in accordance with one of the following methods which shall be adopted by the plan by amendment:
                    (i)
                    by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employer, and
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with all employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws;
                    (ii)
                    by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan by the employer for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years; and
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan (for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years) by all employers who have an obligation to contribute to the plan for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws; or
                    (iii)
                    by multiplying the value of plan assets under subparagraph (C) by a fraction—
                        (I)
                        the numerator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(I) of this subparagraph, less the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(I) which are attributable to service with the employer; and
                        (II)
                        the denominator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(II) of this subparagraph, reduced by the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(II) which are attributable to service with respect to the employers described in such clause (ii)(II).
                (E)
                The amount of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for a plan year preceding the plan year in which an employer withdraws, which is not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which such employer withdraws, is equal to—
                    (i)
                    an amount equal to—
                        (I)
                        the value of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan at the end of such plan year, reduced by
                        (II)
                        the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan at the end of such plan year which are attributable to participants’ service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan for such plan year; reduced by
                    (ii)
                    an amount equal to—
                        (I)
                        the value of the plan assets as of the end of such plan year, reduced by
                        (II)
                        the value of plan assets as of the end of such plan year as determined under subparagraph (C); reduced by
                    (iii)
                    the value of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected with respect to employers withdrawing before the year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws.
                (F)
                The employer’s proportional share described in subparagraph (A)(ii) for a plan year is the amount determined under subparagraph (E) for the employer, but not in excess of an amount which bears the same ratio to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (E) for all employers under the plan as the amount determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer bears to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for all employers under the plan.
                (G)
                The corporation may prescribe by regulation other methods which a plan may adopt for allocating assets to determine the amount of the unfunded vested benefits attributable to service with the employer and to determine the employer’s share of unfunded vested benefits not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year in which the employer withdraws.
            (5)
                (A)
                The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alternative method for determining an employer’s allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.
                (B)
                The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard approaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alternative method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan’s unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.
                (C)
                Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the numerator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employer’s allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.
                (D)
                The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.
                (E)
                    Fresh start option
                Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan may be amended to provide that the withdrawal liability method described in subsection (b) shall be applied by substituting the plan year which is specified in the amendment and for which the plan has no unfunded vested benefits for the plan year ending before
                    September 26, 1980
    Method of calculating allocable share of employer of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3); applicability of certain statutory provisions
        (d)
        Method of calculating allocable share of employer of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3); applicability of certain statutory provisions
            (1)
            The method of calculating an employer’s allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) shall be the method for calculating an employer’s allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which
                section 404(c) of title 26
            (2)
            Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.
    Reduction of liability of withdrawn employer in case of transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to withdrawal or partial withdrawal of employer
        (e)
        Reduction of liability of withdrawn employer in case of transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to withdrawal or partial withdrawal of employer
            In the case of a transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to an employer’s withdrawal or partial withdrawal, the withdrawn employer’s liability under this part shall be reduced in an amount equal to the value, as of the end of the last plan year ending on or before the date of the withdrawal, of the transferred unfunded vested benefits.
    Computations applicable in case of withdrawal following merger of multiemployer plans
        (f)
        Computations applicable in case of withdrawal following merger of multiemployer plans
            In the case of a withdrawal following a merger of multiemployer plans, subsection (b), (c), or (d) shall be applied in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation; except that, if a withdrawal occurs in the first plan year beginning after a merger of multiemployer plans, the determination under this section shall be made as if each of the multiemployer plans had remained separate plans.

        The corporation may prescribe by regulation actuarial assumptions which may be used by a plan actuary in determining the unfunded vested benefits of a plan for purposes of determining an employer’s withdrawal liability under this part. Withdrawal liability under this part shall be determined by each plan on the basis of—
            (1)
            actuarial assumptions and methods which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) and which, in combination, offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan, or

                section 412 of title 26
            (2)
            in the absence of complete data, rely on the data available or on data secured by a sampling which can reasonably be expected to be representative of the status of the entire plan.

            (B)
            the value of the assets of the plan.
§ 1394. Application of plan amendments; exception
        (a)
        No plan rule or amendment adopted after
            January 31, 1981

                (B)
                the greater of 90 percent, or a fraction—
                    (i)
                    the numerator of which is an amount equal to the portion of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits that is attributable to plan participants who have a total of 10 or more years of signatory service, and
                    (ii)

                (D)
                In any case in which a multiemployer plan terminates by the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, or in which substantially all the employers withdraw from a plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from the plan—
                    (i)
                    the liability of each such employer who has withdrawn shall be determined (or redetermined) under this paragraph without regard to subparagraph (B), and
                    (ii)
                    notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan shall be fully allocated among all such employers in a manner not inconsistent with regulations which shall be prescribed by the corporation.
                Withdrawal by an employer from a plan, during a period of 3 consecutive plan years within which substantially all the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
                (E)
                In the case of a partial withdrawal described in
                    section 1385(a) of this title
                    (i)
                    the amount determined under subparagraph (C) (determined without regard to this subparagraph), multiplied by
                    (ii)
                    the fraction determined under
                        section 1386(a)(2) of this title
            (2)
            Withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor under subsection (b)(1) beginning no later than 60 days after the date of the demand notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or of the schedule.
            (3)
            Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C) shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.
            (4)
            The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under paragraph (1)(C), plus accrued interest, if any, in whole or in part, without penalty. If the prepayment is made pursuant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepayment.
            (5)
            In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer’s withdrawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term “default” means—
                (A)
                the failure of an employer to make, when due, any payment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and
                (B)
                any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.
            (6)
            Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
            (7)
            A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer’s withdrawal liability if such rules—
                (A)
                are consistent with this chapter, and
                (B)
                are not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation.
            (8)
            In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employer’s obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.

                In the case of the determination of a plan’s unfunded vested benefits for a plan year, the determination is presumed correct unless a party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of evidence that—
                    (i)
                    the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the determination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), or
                    (ii)
                    the plan’s actuary made a significant error in applying the actuarial assumptions or methods.

                section 1451 of this title
            (3)
            Any arbitration proceedings under this section shall, to the extent consistent with this subchapter, be conducted in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, carried out with the same powers (including subpena power), and enforced in United States courts as an arbitration proceeding carried out under title 9.

        Payments by employer prior and subsequent to determination by arbitrator; adjustments; failure of employer to make payments

§ 1901. Congressional findings
        (1)
        deaf-blindness is among the most severe of all forms of disabilities, and there is a great and continuing need for services and training to help individuals who are deaf-blind attain the highest possible level of development;
        (2)
        due to the rubella epidemic of the 1960’s, the rapidly increasing number of older persons many of whom are experiencing significant losses of both vision and hearing, and recent advances in medical technology that have sustained the lives of many severely disabled individuals, including individuals who are deaf-blind, who might not otherwise have survived, the need for services for individuals who are deaf-blind is even more pressing now than in the past;
        (3)

            (2)
            Notwithstanding subsection (a)(6), an employee may not be considered to have experienced an employment loss if the closing or layoff is the result of the relocation or consolidation of part or all of the employer’s business and, prior to the closing or layoff—
                (A)
                the employer offers to transfer the employee to a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting distance with no more than a 6-month break in employment; or

§ 2102. Notice required before plant closings and mass layoffs
    Notice to employees, State dislocated worker units, and local governments
        (a)
        Notice to employees, State dislocated worker units, and local governments

            (1)
            to each representative of the affected employees as of the time of the notice or, if there is no such representative at that time, to each affected employee; and
            (2)
            to the State or entity designated by the State to carry out rapid response activities under
                section 3174(a)(2)(A) of this title

        (b)
        Reduction of notification period
            (1)
            An employer may order the shutdown of a single site of employment before the conclusion of the 60-day period if as of the time that notice would have been required the employer was actively seeking capital or business which, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown and the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.
            (2)
                (A)
                An employer may order a plant closing or mass layoff before the conclusion of the 60-day period if the closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.
                (B)
                No notice under this chapter shall be required if the plant closing or mass layoff is due to any form of natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlands of the United States.
            (3)
            An employer relying on this subsection shall give as much notice as is practicable and at that time shall give a brief statement of the basis for reducing the notification period.
    Extension of layoff period
        (c)
        Extension of layoff period
        A layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to be a layoff of 6 months or less, shall be treated as an employment loss under this chapter unless—
            (1)
            the extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances (including unforeseeable changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff; and
            (2)
            notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable that the extension beyond 6 months will be required.
    Determinations with respect to employment loss
        (d)
        Determinations with respect to employment loss
            For purposes of this section, in determining whether a plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur, employment losses for 2 or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which is less than the minimum number of employees specified in section 2101(a)(2) or (3) of this title but which in the aggregate exceed that minimum number, and which occur within any 90-day period shall be considered to be a plant closing or mass layoff unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses are the result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of this chapter.
§ 2103. Exemptions
        (1)
        the closing is of a temporary facility or the closing or layoff is the result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking; or
        (2)
        the closing or layoff constitutes a strike or constitutes a lockout not intended to evade the requirements of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall require an employer to serve written notice pursuant to
            section 2102(a) of this title

            The amount for which an employer is liable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by—
                (A)

            In addition, any liability incurred under paragraph (1) with respect to a defined benefit pension plan may be reduced by crediting the employee with service for all purposes under such a plan for the period of the violation.

                section 2102 of this title
            (4)
            If an employer which has violated this chapter proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission that violated this chapter was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of this chapter the court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of the liability or penalty provided for in this section.
            (5)
            A person seeking to enforce such liability, including a representative of employees or a unit of local government aggrieved under paragraph (1) or (3), may sue either for such person or for other persons similarly situated, or both, in any district court of the United States for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, or in which the employer transacts business.

§ 2501. Findings; statement of purpose
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress finds that—
            (1)
            American businesses now and for the remainder of the 20th century will face a dramatically different labor market than the one to which they have become accustomed;
            (2)
            two in every three new entrants to the work force will be women, and to meet labor needs such women must work in all occupational areas including in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
            (3)
            women face significant barriers to their full and effective participation in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
            (4)
            the business community must be prepared to address the barriers that women have to such jobs, in order to successfully integrate them into the work force; and
            (5)
            few resources are available to employers and unions who need assistance in recruiting, training, and retaining women in apprenticeable occupations and other nontraditional occupations.
    Purpose
        (b)
        Purpose
        It is the purpose of this chapter to provide technical assistance to employers and labor unions to encourage employment of women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations. Such assistance will enable business to meet the challenge of Workforce 2000 by preparing employers to successfully recruit, train, and retain women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations and will expand the employment and self-sufficiency options of women. This purpose will be achieved by—
            (1)
            promoting the program to employers and labor unions to inform them of the availability of technical assistance which will assist them in preparing the workplace to employ women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
            (2)
            providing grants to community-based organizations to deliver technical assistance to employers and labor unions to prepare them to recruit, train, and employ women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations;
            (3)
            authorizing the Department of Labor to serve as a liaison between employers, labor, and the community-based organizations providing technical assistance, through its national office and its regional administrators; and
            (4)
            conducting a comprehensive study to examine the barriers to the participation of women in apprenticeable occupations and nontraditional occupations and to develop recommendations for the workplace to eliminate such barriers.

§ 2601. Findings and purposes
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        Congress finds that—
            (1)
            the number of single-parent households and two-parent households in which the single parent or both parents work is increasing significantly;
            (2)
            it is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early childrearing and the care of family members who have serious health conditions;
            (3)
            the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting;
            (4)
            there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods;
            (5)
            due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men; and
            (6)
            employment standards that apply to one gender only have serious potential for encouraging employers to discriminate against employees and applicants for employment who are of that gender.
    Purposes
        (b)
        Purposes
        It is the purpose of this Act—
            (1)
            to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity;
            (2)
            to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition;
            (3)
            to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers;
            (4)
            to accomplish the purposes described in paragraphs (1) and (2) in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons (including maternity-related disability) and for compelling family reasons, on a gender-neutral basis; and
            (5)
            to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to such clause.

§ 2701. Findings
        (1)
        In an increasingly competitive world economy, the companies and nations that lead in the rapid development, commercialization, and application of new and advanced technologies, and in the high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services, will lead in economic growth, employment, and high living standards.
        (2)
        While the United States remains the world leader in science and invention, it has not done well in rapidly making the transition from achievement in its research laboratories to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services. This lag and the unprecedented competitive challenge that the United States has faced from abroad have contributed to a drop in real wages and living standards.
        (3)
        Companies that are successfully competitive in the rapid development, commercialization, application, and implementation of advanced technologies, and in the successful delivery of goods and services, recognize that worker participation and labor-management cooperation in the deployment, application, and implementation of advanced workplace technologies make an important contribution to high-quality, competitively priced production of goods and services and in maintaining and improving real wages for workers.
        (4)
        The Federal Government has an important role in encouraging and augmenting private sector efforts relating to the development, application, manufacture, and deployment of new and advanced technologies. The role should be to—
            (A)
            work with private companies, States, worker organizations, nonprofit organizations, and institutions of higher education to ensure the development, application, production, and implementation of new and advanced technologies to promote the improvement of workers’ skills, wages, job security, and working conditions, and a healthy environment;
            (B)
            encourage worker and worker organization participation in the development, commercialization, evaluation, selection, application, and implementation of new and advanced technologies in the workplace; and
            (C)
            promote the use and integration of new and advanced technologies in the workplace that enhance workers’ skills.
        (5)
        In working with the private sector to promote the technological leadership and economic growth of the United States, the Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that Federal technology programs help the United States to remain competitive and to maintain and improve living standards and to create and retain secure jobs in economically stable communities.

        (2)
