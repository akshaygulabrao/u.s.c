§ 1601. Congressional findings
        (1)
        Federal health services to maintain and improve the health of the Indians are consonant with and required by the Federal Government’s historical and unique legal relationship with, and resulting responsibility to, the American Indian people.
        (2)
        A major national goal of the United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structure that will enable Indian tribes and tribal members to obtain the quantity and quality of health care services and opportunities that will eradicate the health disparities between Indians and the general population of the United States.
        (3)
        A major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of health services which will permit the health status of Indians to be raised to the highest possible level and to encourage the maximum participation of Indians in the planning and management of those services.
        (4)
        Federal health services to Indians have resulted in a reduction in the prevalence and incidence of preventable illnesses among, and unnecessary and premature deaths of, Indians.
        (5)
        Despite such services, the unmet health needs of the American Indian people are severe and the health status of the Indians is far below that of the general population of the United States.
§ 1602. Declaration of national Indian health policy
        (1)
        to ensure the highest possible health status for Indians and urban Indians and to provide all resources necessary to effect that policy;
        (2)
        to raise the health status of Indians and urban Indians to at least the levels set forth in the goals contained within the Healthy People 2010 initiative or successor objectives;
        (3)
        to ensure maximum Indian participation in the direction of health care services so as to render the persons administering such services and the services themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of Indian communities;
        (4)
        to increase the proportion of all degrees in the health professions and allied and associated health professions awarded to Indians so that the proportion of Indian health professionals in each Service area is raised to at least the level of that of the general population;
        (5)
        to require that all actions under this chapter shall be carried out with active and meaningful consultation with Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and conference with urban Indian organizations, to implement this chapter and the national policy of Indian self-determination;

        (a)
        Findings
        Congress finds that—
            (1)
                (A)
                the rate of suicide of American Indians and Alaska Natives is 1.9 times higher than the national average rate; and
                (B)
                the rate of suicide of Indian and Alaska Native youth aged 15 through 24 is—
                    (i)
                    3.5 times the national average rate; and
                    (ii)
                    the highest rate of any population group in the United States;
            (2)
            many risk behaviors and contributing factors for suicide are more prevalent in Indian country than in other areas, including—
                (A)
                history of previous suicide attempts;
                (B)
                family history of suicide;
                (C)
                history of depression or other mental illness;
                (D)
                alcohol or drug abuse;
                (E)
                health disparities;
                (F)
                stressful life events and losses;
                (G)
                easy access to lethal methods;
                (H)
                exposure to the suicidal behavior of others;
                (I)
                isolation; and
                (J)
                incarceration;
            (3)
            according to national data for 2005, suicide was the second-leading cause of death for Indians and Alaska Natives of both sexes aged 10 through 34;
            (4)
                (A)
                the suicide rates of Indian and Alaska Native males aged 15 through 24 are—
                    (i)
                    as compared to suicide rates of males of any other racial group, up to 4 times greater; and
                    (ii)
                    as compared to suicide rates of females of any other racial group, up to 11 times greater; and
                (B)
                data demonstrates that, over their lifetimes, females attempt suicide 2 to 3 times more often than males;
            (5)
                (A)
                Indian tribes, especially Indian tribes located in the Great Plains, have experienced epidemic levels of suicide, up to 10 times the national average; and
                (B)
                suicide clustering in Indian country affects entire tribal communities;
            (6)
            death rates for Indians and Alaska Natives are statistically underestimated because many areas of Indian country lack the proper resources to identify and monitor the presence of disease;
            (7)
                (A)
                the Indian Health Service experiences health professional shortages, with physician vacancy rates of approximately 17 percent, and nursing vacancy rates of approximately 18 percent, in 2007;
                (B)
                90 percent of all teens who die by suicide suffer from a diagnosable mental illness at time of death;
                (C)
                more than ½ of teens who die by suicide have never been seen by a mental health provider; and
                (D)
                ⅓ of health needs in Indian country relate to mental health;
            (8)
            often, the lack of resources of Indian tribes and the remote nature of Indian reservations make it difficult to meet the requirements necessary to access Federal assistance, including grants;
            (9)
            the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Service have established specific initiatives to combat youth suicide in Indian country and among Indians and Alaska Natives throughout the United States, including the National Suicide Prevention Initiative of the Service, which has worked with Service, tribal, and urban Indian health programs since 2003;
            (10)
            the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention was established in 2001 through a Department of Health and Human Services collaboration among—
                (A)
                the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration;
                (B)
                the Service;
                (C)
                the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
                (D)
                the National Institutes of Health; and
                (E)
                the Health Resources and Services Administration; and
            (11)
            the Service and other agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services use information technology and other programs to address the suicide prevention and mental health needs of Indians and Alaska Natives.

        that Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and their resources;
        (3)
        that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe;
        (4)

        (5)
        that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families.

                (C)
                take into account the availability of skilled labor commodities, business and automatic data processing services, related Indian preference and Indian control of education requirements, and any other market factors found to substantially affect the administrative costs and efficiency of each such tribal elementary or secondary educational program studied in order to ensure that all required administrative activities can reasonably be delivered in a cost effective manner for each such program, given an administrative cost allowance generated by the values, percentages, or other factors found in the studies to be relevant in such formula;
                (D)
                identify, and quantify in terms of percentages of direct program costs, any general factors arising from geographic isolation, or numbers of programs administered, independent of program size factors used to compute a base administrative cost percentage in such formula; and
                (E)
                identify any other incremental cost factors substantially affecting the costs of required administrative cost functions at any of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs studied and determine whether the factors are of general applicability to other such programs, and (if so) how the factors may effectively be incorporated into such formula.

                        the local school board requests that such differential be discontinued or decreased; or
                        (II)
                        the Secretary or the supervisor, respectively, determines for clear and convincing reasons (and advises the board in writing of those reasons) that there is no disparity of compensation that would affect the recruitment or retention of employees at the school after the differential is discontinued or decreased.

            In the case of intestate succession under this subsection, if an individual fails to survive the decedent by at least 120 hours, as established by clear and convincing evidence—
                (A)

                        it appears, based on an examination of the will or other evidence, that the will was made in contemplation of the marriage of the testator to the surviving spouse;

                        (I)

§ 2401. Congressional findings
        (1)
        the Federal Government has a historical relationship and unique legal and moral responsibility to Indian tribes and their members,
        (2)
        included in this responsibility is the treaty, statutory, and historical obligation to assist the Indian tribes in meeting the health and social needs of their members,
        (3)
        alcoholism and alcohol and substance abuse is the most severe health and social problem facing Indian tribes and people today and nothing is more costly to Indian people than the consequences of alcohol and substance abuse measured in physical, mental, social, and economic terms,
        (4)
        alcohol and substance abuse is the leading generic risk factor among Indians, and Indians die from alcoholism at over 4 times the age-adjusted rates for the United States population and alcohol and substance misuse results in a rate of years of potential life lost nearly 5 times that of the United States,
        (5)
        4 of the top 10 causes of death among Indians are alcohol and drug related injuries (18 percent of all deaths), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (5 percent), suicide (3 percent), and homicide (3 percent),
        (6)
        primarily because deaths from unintentional injuries and violence occur disproportionately among young people, the age-specific death rate for Indians is approximately double the United States rate for the 15 to 45 age group,
        (7)
        Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are more than 2 times as likely to commit suicide as the general population and approximately 80 percent of those suicides are alcohol-related,
        (8)
        Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are twice as likely as the general population to die in automobile accidents, 75 percent of which are alcohol-related,
        (9)
        the Indian Health Service, which is charged with treatment and rehabilitation efforts, has directed only 1 percent of its budget for alcohol and substance abuse problems,
        (10)
        the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has responsibility for programs in education, social services, law enforcement, and other areas, has assumed little responsibility for coordinating its various efforts to focus on the epidemic of alcohol and substance abuse among Indian people,
        (11)
        this lack of emphasis and priority continues despite the fact that Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service officials publicly acknowledge that alcohol and substance abuse among Indians is the most serious health and social problem facing the Indian people, and
        (12)
        the Indian tribes have the primary responsibility for protecting and ensuring the well-being of their members and the resources made available under this chapter will assist Indian tribes in meeting that responsibility.
§ 2402. Purpose
        (1)
        authorize and develop a comprehensive, coordinated attack upon the illegal narcotics traffic in Indian country and the deleterious impact of alcohol and substance abuse upon Indian tribes and their members,
        (2)
        provide needed direction and guidance to those Federal agencies responsible for Indian programs to identify and focus existing programs and resources, including those made available by this chapter, upon this problem,
        (3)
        provide authority and opportunities for Indian tribes to develop and implement a coordinated program for the prevention and treatment of alcohol and substance abuse at the local level, and

        numerous Indian tribes have become engaged in or have licensed gaming activities on Indian lands as a means of generating tribal governmental revenue;

        existing Federal law does not provide clear standards or regulations for the conduct of gaming on Indian lands;

        a principal goal of Federal Indian policy is to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and strong tribal government; and
        (5)

        (3)
        to declare that the establishment of independent Federal regulatory authority for gaming on Indian lands, the establishment of Federal standards for gaming on Indian lands, and the establishment of a National Indian Gaming Commission are necessary to meet congressional concerns regarding gaming and to protect such gaming as a means of generating tribal revenue.

                Upon the approval of such an ordinance or resolution, the Chairman shall publish in the Federal Register such ordinance or resolution and the order of approval.
                (C)

                        any person or entity operating a class III gaming activity pursuant to this paragraph on the date on which an ordinance or resolution described in clause (i) that revokes authorization for such class III gaming activity is published in the Federal Register may, during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which such revocation ordinance or resolution is published under clause (ii), continue to operate such activity in conformance with the Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) that is in effect, and
                        (II)
                        any civil action that arises before, and any crime that is committed before, the close of such 1-year period shall not be affected by such revocation ordinance or resolution.
            (3)
                (A)
                Any Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the Indian lands upon which a class III gaming activity is being conducted, or is to be conducted, shall request the State in which such lands are located to enter into negotiations for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities. Upon receiving such a request, the State shall negotiate with the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.
                (B)
                Any State and any Indian tribe may enter into a Tribal-State compact governing gaming activities on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe, but such compact shall take effect only when notice of approval by the Secretary of such compact has been published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.
                (C)
                Any Tribal-State compact negotiated under subparagraph (A) may include provisions relating to—
                    (i)
                    the application of the criminal and civil laws and regulations of the Indian tribe or the State that are directly related to, and necessary for, the licensing and regulation of such activity;
                    (ii)
                    the allocation of criminal and civil jurisdiction between the State and the Indian tribe necessary for the enforcement of such laws and regulations;
                    (iii)
                    the assessment by the State of such activities in such amounts as are necessary to defray the costs of regulating such activity;
                    (iv)
                    taxation by the Indian tribe of such activity in amounts comparable to amounts assessed by the State for comparable activities;

            (4)
            Except for any assessments that may be agreed to under paragraph (3)(C)(iii) of this subsection, nothing in this section shall be interpreted as conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions authority to impose any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an Indian tribe to engage in a class III activity. No State may refuse to enter into the negotiations described in paragraph (3)(A) based upon the lack of authority in such State, or its political subdivisions, to impose such a tax, fee, charge, or other assessment.
            (5)
            Nothing in this subsection shall impair the right of an Indian tribe to regulate class III gaming on its Indian lands concurrently with the State, except to the extent that such regulation is inconsistent with, or less stringent than, the State laws and regulations made applicable by any Tribal-State compact entered into by the Indian tribe under paragraph (3) that is in effect.

                    (i)
                    any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or to conduct such negotiations in good faith,

                    any cause of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin a class III gaming activity located on Indian lands and conducted in violation of any Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3) that is in effect, and
                    (iii)

                    An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of action described in subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the Indian tribe requested the State to enter into negotiations under paragraph (3)(A).
                    (ii)
                    In any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), upon the introduction of evidence by an Indian tribe that—

                        a Tribal-State compact has not been entered into under paragraph (3), and
                        (II)
                        the State did not respond to the request of the Indian tribe to negotiate such a compact or did not respond to such request in good faith,
                    the burden of proof shall be upon the State to prove that the State has negotiated with the Indian tribe in good faith to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities.
                    (iii)
                    If, in any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), the court finds that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribe to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities, the court shall order the State and the Indian Tribe

                        (II)
                        shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not negotiated in good faith.
                    (iv)
                    If a State and an Indian tribe fail to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities on the Indian lands subject to the jurisdiction of such Indian tribe within the 60-day period provided in the order of a court issued under clause (iii), the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact that represents their last best offer for a compact. The mediator shall select from the two proposed compacts the one which best comports with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable Federal law and with the findings and order of the court.
                    (v)

                The Secretary is authorized to approve any Tribal-State compact entered into between an Indian tribe and a State governing gaming on Indian lands of such Indian tribe.
                (B)

§ 2901. Findings
        (1)
        the status of the cultures and languages of Native Americans is unique and the United States has the responsibility to act together with Native Americans to ensure the survival of these unique cultures and languages;
        (2)
        special status is accorded Native Americans in the United States, a status that recognizes distinct cultural and political rights, including the right to continue separate identities;
        (3)
        the traditional languages of Native Americans are an integral part of their cultures and identities and form the basic medium for the transmission, and thus survival, of Native American cultures, literatures, histories, religions, political institutions, and values;
        (4)
        there is a widespread practice of treating Native Americans
            1
                1
        (5)
        there is a lack of clear, comprehensive, and consistent Federal policy on treatment of Native American languages which has often resulted in acts of suppression and extermination of Native American languages and cultures;
        (6)
        there is convincing evidence that student achievement and performance, community and school pride, and educational opportunity is clearly and directly tied to respect for, and support of, the first language of the child or student;
        (7)
        it is clearly in the interests of the United States, individual States, and territories to encourage the full academic and human potential achievements of all students and citizens and to take steps to realize these ends;
        (8)
        acts of suppression and extermination directed against Native American languages and cultures are in conflict with the United States policy of self-determination for Native Americans;
        (9)
        languages are the means of communication for the full range of human experiences and are critical to the survival of cultural and political integrity of any people; and
        (10)
        language provides a direct and powerful means of promoting international communication by people who share languages.

§ 3201. Findings and purpose
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        The Congress, after careful review of the problem of child abuse on Indian reservations and the historical and special relationship of the Federal Government with Indian people,
            (1)
            finds that—
                (A)
                incidents of abuse of children on Indian reservations are grossly underreported;
                (B)
                such underreporting is often a result of the lack of a mandatory Federal reporting law;
                (C)
                multiple incidents of sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations have been perpetrated by persons employed or funded by the Federal Government;
                (D)
                Federal Government investigations of the background of Federal employees who care for, or teach, Indian children are often deficient;
                (E)
                funds spent by the United States on Indian reservations or otherwise spent for the benefit of Indians who are victims of child abuse or family violence are inadequate to meet the growing needs for mental health treatment and counseling for victims of child abuse or family violence and their families; and
                (F)
                there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for membership in, an Indian tribe; and
            (2)
            declares that two major goals of the United States are to—
                (A)
                identify the scope of incidents of abuse of children and family violence in Indian country and to reduce such incidents; and
                (B)
                provide funds for mental health treatment for Indian victims of child abuse and family violence on Indian reservations.
    Purpose
        (b)
        Purpose
        The purposes of this chapter are to—
            (1)
            require that reports of abused Indian children are made to the appropriate authorities in an effort to prevent further abuse;
            (2)
            establish a reliable data base for statistical purposes and to authorize a study to determine the need for a central registry for reported incidents of abuse;
            (3)
            authorize such other actions as are necessary to ensure effective child protection in Indian country;
            (4)
            establish the Indian Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Grant Program to provide funds for the establishment on Indian reservations of treatment programs for victims of child sexual abuse;
            (5)
            provide for technical assistance and training related to the investigation and treatment of cases of child abuse and neglect;
            (6)
            establish Indian Child Resource and Family Services Centers in each Bureau of Indian Affairs Area Office which will consist of multi-disciplinary teams of personnel with experience and training in the prevention, identification, investigation, and treatment of child abuse and neglect;
            (7)
            provide for the treatment and prevention of incidents of family violence;
            (8)
            establish tribally operated programs to protect Indian children and reduce the incidents of family violence in Indian country; and
            (9)
            authorize other actions necessary to ensure effective child protection on Indian reservations.

§ 3651. Findings
        (1)
        there is a government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes;
        (2)
        Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are responsible for exercising governmental authority over Indian lands;
        (3)
        the rate of violent crime committed in Indian country is approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in the United States as a whole;
        (4)
        in any community, a high rate of violent crime is a major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic growth;
        (5)
        tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the health and safety and the political integrity of tribal governments;
        (6)
        Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights on Native lands;
        (7)
        enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;
        (8)
        there is both inadequate funding and an inadequate coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their operation;
        (9)
        tribal court membership organizations have served a critical role in providing training and technical assistance for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;
        (10)
        Indian legal services programs, as funded partially through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian people in tribal court forums, and also contribute significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal jurisprudence; and
        (11)
        the provision of adequate technical assistance to tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and tribal courts is an essential element in the development of strong tribal court systems.
§ 3652. Purposes
        (1)
        to carry out the responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes by ensuring access to quality technical and legal assistance.
        (2)
        To strengthen and improve the capacity of tribal court systems that address civil and criminal causes of action under the jurisdiction of Indian tribes.
        (3)
        To strengthen tribal governments and the economies of Indian tribes through the enhancement and, where appropriate, development of tribal court systems for the administration of justice in Indian country by providing technical and legal assistance services.
        (4)
        To encourage collaborative efforts between national or regional membership organizations and associations whose membership consists of judicial system personnel within tribal justice systems; non-profit entities which provide legal assistance services for Indian tribes, members of Indian tribes, and/or tribal justice systems.

§ 3801. Findings
        (1)
        the Secretary of the Interior has identified 53 dams on Indian lands that present a threat to human life in the event of a failure;
        (2)
        because of inadequate attention in the past to problems stemming from structural deficiencies and regular maintenance requirements for dams operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, unsafe Bureau dams continue to pose an imminent threat to people and property;
        (3)
        many Bureau dams have maintenance deficiencies regardless of their current safety condition classification and the deficiencies must be corrected to avoid future threats to human life and property;
        (4)
        safe working dams on Indian lands are necessary to supply irrigation water, to provide flood control, to provide water for municipal, industrial, domestic, livestock, and recreation uses, and for fish and wildlife habitats; and
        (5)
        it is necessary to institute a regular dam maintenance and repair program, utilizing the expertise in the Bureau, Indian tribes, and other Federal agencies.

        Development of list
            (1)
            Development of list
                The Secretary shall develop a comprehensive list of dams located on Indian lands that describes the dam safety condition classification of each dam, as specified in paragraph (2), the risk hazard classification of each dam, as specified in paragraph (3), and the conditions resulting from maintenance deficiencies.
        Dam safety condition classifications
            (2)
            Dam safety condition classifications
            The dam safety condition classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications:
            Satisfactory
                (A)
                Satisfactory
                    No existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. Safe performance is expected under all anticipated conditions.
            Fair
                (B)
                Fair
                    No existing dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal loading conditions. Infrequent hydrologic or seismic events would probably result in a dam safety deficiency.
            Conditionally poor
                (C)
                Conditionally poor
                    A potential dam safety deficiency is recognized for unusual loading conditions that may realistically occur during the expected life of the structure.
            Poor
                (D)
                Poor
                    A potential dam safety deficiency is clearly recognized for normal loading conditions. Immediate actions to resolve the deficiency are recommended; reservoir restrictions may be necessary until resolution of the problem.
            Unsatisfactory
                (E)
                Unsatisfactory
                    A dam safety deficiency exists for normal loading conditions. Immediate remedial action is required for resolution of the problem.
        Risk hazard classification
            (3)
            Risk hazard classification
            The risk hazard classification referred to in paragraph (1) is one of the following classifications:
            High
                (A)
                High
                    Six or more lives would be at risk or extensive property damage could occur if the dam failed.
            Significant
                (B)
                Significant
                    Between one and six lives would be at risk or significant property damage could occur if the dam failed.
            Low
                (C)
                Low
                    No lives would be at risk and limited property damage would occur if the dam failed.
    Limitation on program authorization
        (f)
        Limitation on program authorization
            Work authorized by this chapter shall be for the purpose of dam safety maintenance and structural repair. The Secretary may authorize, upon request of an Indian tribe, up to 20 percent of the cost of repairs to be used to provide additional conservation storage capacity or developing benefits beyond those provided by the original dams and reservoirs. This chapter is not intended to preclude development of increased storage or benefits under any other authority or to preclude measures to protect fish and wildlife.
    Technical assistance
        (g)
        Technical assistance
            To carry out the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary may obtain technical assistance on a nonreimbursable basis from other departments and agencies.

            (B)
            by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and
            (C)
            by developing effective partnerships among the Federal Government, State, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities;
        (2)
        there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;
        (3)

        (4)
        the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;

        (7)
        Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in

                If the unit is a homeownership unit not conveyed within 25 years from the date of full availability, the recipient shall not be considered to have lost the legal right to own, operate, or maintain the unit if the unit has not been conveyed to the homebuyer for reasons beyond the control of the recipient.
                (C)

§ 4301. Findings; purposes
    Findings
        (a)
        Findings
        Congress finds that—
            (1)
            clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the United States and Indian Tribes;
            (2)
            beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each President has reaffirmed the special government-to-government relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States;
            (3)
            in 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies that obligated all Federal departments and agencies, particularly those that have an impact on economic development, to evaluate the potential impacts of their actions on Indian Tribes;
            (4)
            consistent with the principles of inherent Tribal sovereignty and the special relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States, Indian Tribes retain the right to enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and seek enforcement of treaty and trade rights;
            (5)
            Congress has carried out the responsibility of the United States for the protection and preservation of Indian Tribes and the resources of Indian Tribes through the endorsement of treaties, and the enactment of other laws, including laws that provide for the exercise of administrative authorities;
            (6)
            the United States has an obligation to guard and preserve the sovereignty of Indian Tribes in order to foster strong Tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency among Indian Tribes;
            (7)
            the capacity of Indian Tribes to build strong Tribal governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the inability of Indian Tribes to engage communities that surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic activities on Indian lands;
            (8)
            despite the availability of abundant natural resources on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and associated social ills than those of any other group in the United States;
            (9)
            the United States has an obligation to assist Indian Tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and political conditions with respect to Indian lands to—
                (A)
                encourage investment from outside sources that do not originate with the Tribes; and
                (B)
                facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that are not Tribal entities;
            (10)
            the economic success and material well-being of Native American communities depends on the combined efforts of the Federal Government, Tribal governments, the private sector, and individuals;
            (11)
            the lack of employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in the communities referred to in paragraph (7) has resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal assistance that is—
                (A)
                insufficient to address the magnitude of needs; and
                (B)
                unreliable in availability; and
            (12)
            the twin goals of economic self-sufficiency and political self-determination for Native Americans can best be served by making available to address the challenges faced by those groups—
                (A)
                the resources of the private market;
                (B)
                adequate capital; and
                (C)
                technical expertise.
    Purposes
        (b)
        Purposes
        The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
            (1)
            To revitalize economically and physically distressed Native American economies by—
                (A)
                encouraging the formation of new businesses by eligible entities, and the expansion of existing businesses; and
                (B)
                facilitating the movement of goods to and from Indian lands and the provision of services by Indians.
            (2)
            To promote private investment in the economies of Indian Tribes and to encourage the sustainable development of resources of Indian Tribes and Indian-owned businesses.
            (3)
            To promote the long-range sustained growth of the economies of Indian Tribes.
            (4)
            To raise incomes of Indians in order to reduce the number of Indians at poverty levels and provide the means for achieving a higher standard of living on Indian reservations.
            (5)
            To encourage intertribal, regional, and international trade and business development in order to assist in increasing productivity and the standard of living of members of Indian Tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency of the governing bodies of Indian Tribes.
            (6)
            To promote economic self-sufficiency and political self-determination for Indian Tribes and members of Indian Tribes.

§ 5301. Congressional statement of findings
    Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities
        (a)
        Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities
        The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government’s historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American Indian people, finds that—
            (1)
            the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and
            (2)
            the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.
    Further findings
        (b)
        Further findings
        The Congress further finds that—
            (1)
            true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;
            (2)
            the Federal responsibility for and assistance to education of Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement or created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide; and
            (3)
            parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people.

    Declaration of commitment
        (b)
        Declaration of commitment
            The Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government’s unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.
    Declaration of national goal
        (c)
        Declaration of national goal

                (E)
                the program, function, service, or activity (or portion thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under paragraph (1) because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.

                (B)
                proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the applicable level determined under
                    section 5325(a) of this title
            subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the tribal organization agree to, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, approve such portion of the program, function, service, or activity as is authorized under paragraph (1) or approve a level of funding authorized under
                section 5325(a) of this title

§ 5601. Findings
        (1)
        there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes;
        (2)
        there exists a unique Federal responsibility to Indians;
        (3)
        through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indians;
        (4)
        the fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to Indians also are founded in part on specific commitments made through written treaties and agreements securing peace, in exchange for which Indians have surrendered claims to vast tracts of land, which provided legal consideration for permanent, ongoing performance of Federal trust duties; and
        (5)
        the foregoing historic Federal-tribal relations and understandings have benefitted the people of the United States as a whole for centuries and have established enduring and enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor has been committed.
§ 5602. Reaffirmation of policy
        Pursuant to the constitutionally vested authority of Congress over Indian affairs, Congress reaffirms that the responsibility of the United States to Indian tribes includes a duty to promote tribal self-determination regarding governmental authority and economic development.
